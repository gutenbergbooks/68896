<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the northern end of the Shawangunk range lies
a region where the Maker of Mountains went mad.</p>

<p>Into his new-laid rock the giant crashed his huge
hammer, smashing asunder his handiwork, gouging
out chasms, splitting it into fissure and cavern and
abyss, slashing its eastern edge into a frowning precipice.
When he had gone, up into some of his hammer-scars
welled subterranean waters, forming crag-bound
lakes hundreds of feet higher than the rugged valley
floor. Other chasms became gulfs of verdure,
crammed with a veritable jungle of hardwoods and
evergreens. And there, in the labyrinth of tree and
bowlder, fierce brutes and venomous snakes bred and
fought and slew. It was the home of the wolf, the
panther, and the bear; of the rattlesnake and the copperhead.</p>

<p>Then came men: savages who killed and ate the
wild beasts and clothed themselves in their furry hides.
Through the gorges and down the slopes they laid their
trails, along which they roved for centuries in hunt
and tribal war. At length they paused, staring eastward
at new fires burning below them—the fires of
white men.</p>

<p>The inevitable followed. First by firewater, then by
firearms, the Dutch settlers crowded the tawny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
“duyvils” out of the forested lowlands between the
river of Hendrick Hudson and the mountain wall.
But behind that wall, in the natural stronghold created
by the mad Mountain-Maker, the red men long held
their own. More, at times they swooped out from the
one small gap in the cliffs on bloody raids. And when
the vengeful whites retaliated with invasions of their
fastness, they ambushed those palefaces along their
trails.</p>

<p>Then the settlers ended it. Trapped again and again
within that gulf, they in turn became the trappers.
Stealthily moving in force, they garrisoned the heights
of Mohonk and Minnewaska; they outwitted, outmanœuvred,
outambushed the Indians; they herded
them back against their own precipices, cornered them
among their own bowlders, slew them without mercy.
Returning to their lowland farms, they left behind
them a silent, blood-spattered, death-strewn hole in the
hills which henceforth—because of its traps and
countertraps—was to be known as The Traps.</p>

<p>Long afterward, men came in again; white men,
and red men too, no longer foes. They cleared little
farms, brought in their women, intermarried and interbred,
led such primitive existences as might have
been expected. Dwelling in their own little world,
they followed their own inclinations in such matters
as mating and hunting and drinking—and thereby
achieved a reputation somewhat dubious. The tongue-wagging
folk outside declared the Trapsmen were
“wife-swappers” and “moonshiners” and other
things. And perhaps they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>Rumor has asserted, too, that these men first settled
that craggy hole not because they would but because
they must; that the country outside was “too hot”
for them; that they even had to obtain their wives by
becoming squaw men or by the primeval custom of
capture; and that for many years their land was distinctly
unsafe for any man not of their clan. This
also may be true. Be that as it may, they lived hard
lives, and many of them died hard deaths. Yet they
lived as free men, untrammeled by slavish subservience
to the myriad laws manufactured in the cities beyond
them.</p>

<p>But they, too, passed. As the bear and the wolf
and the Indian faded out of that country after the
coming of the white man, so the Trapsmen have almost
vanished before the encroachments of commercialism.
Beside the upland lakes now rise those structures
from which the pioneer turns with loathing—summer
hotels. Moreover, virtually all of the intervening
Traps has been bought in by the hotel barons.
The little homes of the vanished men are slowly rotting
apart; their tiny fields and their hard-grown orchards
are going the way of the ancient Indian trails—disappearing
into wilderness where snakes thrive
unmolested. Few indeed are the people who now live
in the mountain bowl; fewer still those who are native-born.
The others are from outside.</p>

<p>Yet there are, in the region round about, two or
three old men—taciturn, abrupt, whole-souled old fellows—who
were born in the Traps and who will die
not far from the Traps. From them, and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
whispering ghosts which, by day and by dark, have
drifted along beside me on the silent trails and talked
to me in weird crevasse and uncanny old house, I have
learned the tale which is here set down. It is a tale
of Yesterday, in a land of Yesterday, chronicled by
one who was there—yesterday.</p>

<p class="ph2">Cat o’ Mountain</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE PANTHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">High</span> on the crags a panther screamed.</p>

<p>Savage, sinister, yet appallingly human—like the
malevolent squall of an infuriated hag—the cry tore
through the night shadows whelming the mountain-girt
gulf of the Traps. Among the gigantic bowlders
and the uncanny crevasses of Dickie Barre it hurtled
in a shattered wave of sound. Out across the dense
tangle of underbrush and the lazy-creeping water of
Coxing Hill it fled, freezing in their tracks the smaller
brethren of the wild—fox and raccoon and rabbit and
mink—which moved there in their furtive foraging.
From the forested steeps of Mohonk and Millbrook
it reverberated, and among those trees it was swallowed
up.</p>

<p>Again the malignant wail broke out; and now the
beast which voiced it was not in the same spot as
before. Somewhere on the very brink of the precipice
of Dickie Barre the huge cat had been, and somewhere
on that edge he still was. But he was moving, seeking
a crack or crevice through which he might steal swiftly
downward without hurling himself to death on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
rubble of cliff-fragments below; and his failure to find
it at once exasperated his ugly nature to its ugliest.
His eyes told him something down there was moving.
His nose said the thing was human, was hurt, was
harmless. His fierce brain knew it would be an easy
kill, and his ravening jaws slavered at the realization
that after one rending attack he could gorge himself—on
the tender flesh of a woman.</p>

<p>Baffled, maddened, he screeched once more. Then
he became silent. He had found something promising:
not a direct line of descent, but a narrow shelf dipping
diagonally down the face of the cliff. Along this he
proceeded with swift, sure stealth.</p>

<p>Then, down in the density behind him, a light shot
out from between two towering bowlders. A clean,
brilliant beam it was—the ray of a carbide camp-lamp.
Its white sheen played up, down, right, left; and as it
moved, the rock-masses and the trees and brush round
about stood forth, then vanished again into the gloom.
But it did not advance. Between those two colossal
blocks it stayed, peering like a dazzling eye.</p>

<p>All at once it jumped. From the chaos of chunks
between silent cat and silent light, a voice had cried
out.</p>

<p>“Help! Oh—help!”</p>

<p>It was a high, clear, penetrating call, with an under-note
of terror and pain.</p>

<p>Two voices answered: one, a ferine snarl from the
merciless cat-creature beyond; the other, a quick response
in the tones of a man.</p>

<p>“Right here! Where are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Here into the—the rocks! Oh, hurry up, before
that critter gits to me!”</p>

<p>“Coming!”</p>

<p>The glaring white eye moved forward in haste.
Behind it, boots scraped and bumped on rock. It rose
in a steep slant, slid suddenly down, accompanied by
more scraping of boot-heels; disappeared between two
blocks leaning together; emerged beyond, ascended
again, wavering erratically with the strain of climbing
a treacherous slope; halted at the peak of another
bowlder and rapidly searched the surroundings.</p>

<p>“Can’t see you!” the man panted. “Speak up!”</p>

<p>“Hold stiddy a minute!” implored the other voice.
“I’m a-comin’—up this rock—if I don’t slip. Oh!”
The last was a choked moan.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Hurt?”</p>

<p>“Ye-yes. But wait—I’m a-comin’——”</p>

<p>The light quivered, as if the man behind it were
impatient to leap forward. But it remained poised
on its own bowlder, shooting at the upper edge of
another mass of conglomerate beyond which the girlish
voice had spoken. A few seconds later, atop that
rough stone, something glinted red-gold in the white
glare. Under it rose wide gray eyes, a pale face—the
eyes suddenly shut and the face shrank from the
blinding beam. Again the gas ray lit up the glowing
glory of the red hair.</p>

<p>“All right. Stick there,” commanded the man. A
quick twist of the light—then another grind of sliding
heels, terminating in a solid bump like the impact of a
gun-butt against stone. The white eye now was swinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
about at the base of the bowlder, hunting a way
around the almost vertical block. A few seconds, and
it began staggering over the smaller debris toward one
corner.</p>

<p>“Oh—look out—here’s the critter now!”</p>

<p>With the warning came a swift scramble overhead.
The light wheeled and revealed a girlish figure in a
torn drab dress swinging itself out—slipping rapidly
down—hanging by its hands from the upper edge.</p>

<p>“Hold hard!” snapped the man. “Don’t be silly—he’s
a coward, like all cats. He’ll run if you say
‘boo.’ Hang tight a minute. Don’t drop.”</p>

<p>But the girl, dangling with face turned upward and
heels a yard or more above the jagged jumble below,
sniffed scornfully at his assertion of knowledge. Before
he could make two steps toward her she let go.
Down she darted in a grayish streak, and on the stones
beneath she crumpled.</p>

<p>One sharp moan of pain broke from her. Then,
looking upward, she breathed: “Look!”</p>

<p>The light switched up. From the edge above now
protruded another head: a flat-nosed, fang-toothed,
tawny visage whose eyes flamed green with ferocity
and whose snarling jaws writhed in malignant menace.</p>

<p>A startled grunt sounded behind the light. The
white eye lifted, hung poised as if held by a hand
grown rigid. Beside it, twin tubes of steel centered
on that horrid head.</p>

<p><i>Boomboom!</i> A double flash leaped thundering from
the tubes. In a swirl of blue smoke the face of the
great cat vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>The light pitched backward, fell clattering on the
rocks. A muffled impact and a sullen thwack of
metal told that the man and his gun too had been
knocked down by the recoil. Over behind the bowlder
something else thudded softly and was still.</p>

<p>But, though dropped, the lantern burned faithfully
on. Its ray lit up a pair of high-laced boots, tan
corduroys, and a hammerless shotgun sprawling on a
slanting bowlder. A second later a broad hand
swooped at it and righted it. The gun was lifted,
broken at the breech, swiftly reloaded and snapped
shut. Then the legs drew up and the light rose, darting
at the girl.</p>

<p>She was huddled where she had dropped, but her
pale face was alive and her gray eyes wide open. As
the glare fell on her she threw up an arm to shield
her dark-dilated pupils. Upon the tanned skin of that
firm young forearm showed a long red gash.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! You’re badly hurt!” exclaimed the
man.</p>

<p>The lips under the shadowing arm curved in a
strained smile.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t much,” she deprecated. “I got a gouge
when I tumbled. Guess you kilt Mister Catamount,
or scairt him off anyway. They take a mighty lot of
killin’ sometimes. Now can you git me down to where
I can walk? My ankle’s hurt.”</p>

<p>A quiet laugh of admiration came from the invisible
man.</p>

<p>“You’re a plucky little lady,” he informed her.
“Most girls in your place would be fainting or going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
all to pieces. As for walking, I don’t know. This is
a tough hole to navigate in after dark. But we’ll see.”</p>

<p>The light moved toward her. As it advanced
the man added in a chiding tone: “You shouldn’t
have dropped like that. No wonder your ankle’s
hurt.”</p>

<p>“Is that so! What was I goin’ to do, Mister
Smarty—let that critter claw me? And I hurt my
leg an hour ago, not jest now. And I wish you’d look
and see if the catamount’s alive yet. He’s been
pesterin’ round here ’most a month, and you better
kill him good and dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s dead enough——”</p>

<p>“You go and look!”</p>

<p>Again the quiet laugh sounded.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, my lady. I think I heard him fall
over back there.”</p>

<p>Once more the light turned. It wavered around
the base of the bowlder, bobbed up and down among
the jags and juts of the rock-heap, paused, swung
slowly, came to rest on a furry huddle hanging limp
over a misshapen stone. There dangled two powerful
fore-legs, topped by massive shoulders, terminated by
big paws. Between them hung a red ruin which had
been a head.</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled the man, studying the size of the
legs and the breadth of the back. “What a brute!
Never knew they grew so big. Lucky he was close
enough to take those charges before they could spread.
Otherwise that bird-shot would only have maddened
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Turning, he picked his way back to the spot where
the girl waited. He found her sitting up on a stone
and frowning down at her left foot. For the first
time he observed that her feet and the shapely ankles
above them were bare. The left one was much
swollen.</p>

<p>“He’s as dead as they make ’em,” he sang out
cheerily. “We’re a bunged-up lot, aren’t we? Cat
lost his head, your arm and foot are hurt, and my
right shoulder’s kicked into the middle of my back
from letting both barrels go at once. And even my
gun is all mauled from falling on the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t that too bad?” The tone was amusedly
sarcastic. “But I guess I’m the wust off—I’ve got
more bad luck comin’.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“I’ll catch hell when I git home,” was the naive
explanation.</p>

<p>For a minute the man was speechless. Then he
chuckled.</p>

<p>“So? Then why go home?”</p>

<p>The mountain girl’s answer was as straightforward
as before.</p>

<p>“I don’t know any other place to go.”</p>

<p>Her sober face told that she spoke the gaunt truth,
and that she dreaded the thought of returning to the
house whence she had come. An awkward pause followed.</p>

<p>“Well, you may not get there to-night,” the man
declared. “I doubt if I can find my way out of this
mess of rocks before daylight, and you certainly can’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
go scrambling around on that bad foot. You’ll have to
come to my camp now and get bandaged up.”</p>

<p>The auburn brows drew together in another frown,
and the eyes under them peered toward him in open
suspicion.</p>

<p>“I ain’t so sure about that,” she asserted. “I can
git home some way alone, if I have to, and I don’t
figger to stay up here all night. Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a rambling camper. But don’t be silly.
I’m not a skunk. I’ll gladly take you home if it’s
possible and sensible, but until you’re in condition to
travel it’s neither. Now you need a bandage on that
arm, some hot water on the ankle, and—are you
hungry?”</p>

<p>“I’m ’most starved,” she admitted. “I got mad and
run away this mornin’, and I ain’t et since breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Oho! I’m afraid you’re a temperamental little
redbird. Well, come on down to camp and I’ll feed
you bacon and beans—and hot coffee, lots of it.
How’s that?”</p>

<p>“Sounds awful good. I guess you’re all right. You
go ’long and show the way.”</p>

<p>She turned about on her stone. The movement disclosed
a long rent in the faded dress, running from
arm to waist, through which glowed pink flesh. Her
skirt, too, was badly ripped. The man behind the
light switched it from her to the formidable mass of
stones ahead.</p>

<p>“If you can stub along on one foot,” he suggested,
“we can make better progress by hugging each other.
I can stand it if you can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>A quick laugh answered him. The light veered
back, revealing dancing eyes, perfect teeth, and flushed
cheeks under the glowing hair.</p>

<p>“I can stand ’most anything—if I have to,” she
flashed. “And it looks like I’d have to.”</p>

<p>“By George! Young lady, you’re a little beauty
when you laugh! I think I’m going to enjoy this trip.
Wait a minute and I’ll let you put your arm around
my neck.”</p>

<p>Followed the grind of boot-soles and the approach
of the lamp.</p>

<p>“You’re awful good.” She laughed again. “You’d
ought to sell soft soap for a livin’, you’ve got so much
of it.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That’ll do. Now let’s walk.”</p>

<p>Slowly the white eye wobbled along among the
tumbled blocks. The only sounds behind it were those
of labored breathing and curt directions regarding the
placing of feet. Not once did the girl whimper from
the pain of the injured ankle.</p>

<p>Presently the pair of tall cliff-chunks took shape
ahead, their bases lost among smaller stones, their
crests invisible in the upper gloom, their irregular sides
framing a narrow black cañon which seemed to end in
emptiness. But out from that gloomy slit drifted a
tang of smouldering wood-smoke; and beyond it, the
girl knew, the hidden camp of her unknown rescuer
waited.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the covert they paused. So
narrow was the passage that they could no longer
advance side by side. But the carbide flame showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
that the footing ahead was smooth and almost level,
offering no obstacle to her progress alone; also, that
the distance to the cavern beyond was hardly more
than a couple of rods.</p>

<p>“Now if you’ll hop along by yourself for a few
yards more you’ll be there,” spoke the tall, vague form
behind the metal lamp. “Sorry my doorway’s so
tight, but it was made before I came here.”</p>

<p>The injured girl, drooping against a stone beside her,
let the jest pass without a smile.</p>

<p>“You go ahead,” she prompted wearily. “You’ve
got boots.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” he puzzled.</p>

<p>“Snakes.”</p>

<p>“Ouch! Snakes around here?”</p>

<p>“Why, sure. This country’s full of ’em—rattlers
and copperheads. Guess you ain’t been into here long,
mister.”</p>

<p>“Right. I haven’t. But—Lordy! You shouldn’t
go around barefoot in snake country.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe. But folks can’t wear out their shoes into
summer if they’re goin’ to have ’em for winter, can
they?”</p>

<p>He made no reply. Into the gap he turned, and
through it he passed to the larger space beyond, his
wide shoulders rubbing the rock as he passed. Behind
him she limped along, leaning against one wall.</p>

<p>At the end of the little cañon he stepped downward,
halted, and set gun and lamp on a rock shelf. Some
twenty feet away, under an overhang of the cliff, an
open blanket-roll and various small camp-tools showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
beside an Indian fire—short sticks laid like wagon-wheel
spokes, with the flame at the hub.</p>

<p>“Now you can hug me for the last time—maybe,”
he solemnly stated. “I’m going to tote you over there.
It’s rough going.”</p>

<p>With which she was lifted and carried across a rubble
of fragments to the blankets.</p>

<p>As he straightened up in the brilliant light thrown
across by the lamp, she saw him plainly for the first
time: a lithe, firm-jawed man whose face glowed red
with new sunburn between a gray flannel shirt and a
head of silky blond hair; a clean-mouthed, clean-limbed
chap whose twinkling blue eyes might have
brought an approving smile to the lips of many a girl
far more critical of men than this maiden of the mountains.
But no hint of liking for her new-found friend
dawned in her face.</p>

<p>Into her eyes darted a light of mingled recognition,
suspicion, repulsion. She shrank from him as if he
had suddenly become one of those snakes against
which she had just warned him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” she breathed. “It’s you! The detective!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>NIGGER NAT’S GIRL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Blank</span> astonishment crept across the countenance
of the blond man. Motionless as the rocks around him
he stood, staring down at the hostile face upturned to
his.</p>

<p>“Detective? Me?” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Yes, you!” she flared. “Think you’re smart, don’t
you? Mebbe you think us folks are a lot of numbskulls,
but we ain’t. And seein’ you jest helped me
out of a fix, I’ll tell you somethin’, Mister Spy—you
better git out of the Traps right quick, while you’re
able to travel!”</p>

<p>The man threw back his head and laughed—a
gurgling laugh of pure enjoyment.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t rich!” he chuckled. “Old Cap
Hampton, the famous dee-teck-tiff! Say, little redbird,
I’m glad you dropped in this evening. I was
thinking I’d go to-morrow, but now I reckon I’ll stay
awhile. Looks as if this place might prove interesting.”</p>

<p>The gray eyes snapped.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll be interestin’!” was the ominous prediction.
“If you don’t git right outside the Big Wall and
stay out—some of the boys will be sleepin’ into new
blankets and totin’ a newfangled shotgun, I shouldn’t
wonder.”</p>

<p>His gaze dropped to the blankets under her, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
were obviously new; then darted to his hammerless
gun across the way. When his eyes returned to hers
the merriment was gone from them. They glinted like
cold blue steel.</p>

<p>“So that’s the game, eh?” His voice was hard-edged.
“To kill a stranger for his gun and money.
Well, your ‘boys’ are slow. They were snooping
around my camp down by the creek last night, but
they didn’t have the nerve to do anything but watch.
Thanks for your tip. Hereafter I’ll load my gun with
buckshot. You can tell your friends that.”</p>

<p>A flush of anger dyed the girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“Oh, that ain’t it!” she denied. “Strangers are
safe enough, long’s they mind their own business. But
we’ve got no use for sneakin’ spies that den up into
the rocks like copperheads. And if you think anybody’s
scairt of your buckshot, Mister Spy, jest remember
this is old Injun country, and folks was
gittin’ kilt into the Traps before your grandpop was
borned. If all the dead men that’s been shot and
tommyhawked round here should git up all together
they’d—they’d shake the hills with their trompin’!
You and your buckshot—ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>Her scornful laugh stung like a whip-lash. Yet,
though his sunburned face grew still redder under its
sting, he thought: “Lordy, what a stunning little
beauty she is with that color! There’s more than one
kind of wildcat in these hills, too. I like this place
better every minute.”</p>

<p>Aloud he said: “All right, fair damosel. I don’t
know——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Abruptly she started up—winced and paled as her
sprained ankle stabbed with pain—but caught the wall
and faced him in righteous wrath.</p>

<p>“Don’t you cuss me!” she blazed.</p>

<p>“Huh? I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“You did! You called me a dam-somethin’——”</p>

<p>“Oho! Fair damosel? Why, that’s an old-fashioned
compliment—means ‘beautiful girl,’ or something
like that. Would you rather be called a cross-eyed
old maid?”</p>

<p>“No!” The word snapped. But she smiled in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>“You must be a furriner to talk like that,” she
added. “Why don’t you say what you mean? Dam-o-sell—that
ain’t a name to call folks by. It’s ’most
the same as what mom calls me.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Dambrat.”</p>

<p>He regarded her a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“Your mother calls you a brat?” he slowly asked
then.</p>

<p>“Brat—and lots of other things,” she nodded.
“And now I’ve got to git home. I’ll git a good hidin’,
I shouldn’t wonder, but I won’t stay here——”</p>

<p>“You will!” came his incisive contradiction.
“You’ll stay here until that foot is doctored and
you’ve had some food. Sit down!”</p>

<p>At the crisp crackle of his command she eyed him
in surprised defiance. Her chin lifted, and she took
a combative step on the hurt foot. Pallor and pain
swept again across her face, and she staggered. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
promptly picked her up, squirming and resisting; set
her down on the blankets, and inexorably held her
there. Then, his eyes boring into hers, he spoke in
cool determination.</p>

<p>“Behave yourself. Listen to me.</p>

<p>“You’re not going away until I say so. I’ll not say
so until you’re better able to travel. You won’t be
able to travel until that ankle is reduced. It won’t be
reduced until I’ve worked on it. That’s all there is
to that.</p>

<p>“Now about me. I’m no detective. I am Douglas
Hampton, a rover, a drifter, with no home and no
folks. I’ve been in quite a few places, done quite a
few things; but I’ve never been a detective and I don’t
intend to be one. My last job was as reporter on a
New York newspaper, and I lasted almost a year.
Got fired last week because the city editor rode me too
hard and I sat him down in his own waste-basket.
Now I’m in here because I feel like roughing it awhile
and somebody told me it was rough up here in the
Shawangunks.</p>

<p>“I intended to stay here only a day or two and then
ramble along, stopping again wherever I found something
that hit my fancy. But now that people around
here think they’re going to kick me out—I’ll stay
longer. I’m one of those cantankerous chaps who can
be coaxed a mile but can’t be kicked an inch. I always
kick back.</p>

<p>“As I started to say awhile ago, I don’t know the
history of this hole in the hills, but I’m right willing
to learn all about it—past and present. And if people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
around here want to consider me a detective, let ’em.
I don’t care what they think. The only reason why
I’m telling <i>you</i> who I am is—well, because I feel like
it.”</p>

<p>With that he took his hands from her shoulders
and straightened up. She made no move to rise
again. Steadily she probed his face, and slowly she
nodded.</p>

<p>“You talk straight,” she admitted. “But if you
ain’t here to spy, what are you doin’ up here, hid into
the ledge? Folks said you went out through the Gap
this mornin’ with your pack and all. So to-night I
thought you must be some new feller.”</p>

<p>“I did go. I moved because I want to sleep at
night instead of watching men sneak around in the
bushes. Then I decided to come back, and I came.
Didn’t try to hide myself, either—tramped right along
the road. You people ought to keep sharper watch
on desperate dee-teck-tiffs who wander in and out of
here; you never know when they’ll come back.”</p>

<p>His cheerful grin brought an answering smile this
time. But it did not last long. At his next question
it vanished.</p>

<p>“By the way, what am I supposed to detect in here?
Detectives have to detect something, you know.”</p>

<p>“You be careful, mister, or you’ll detect a rock
fallin’ off onto your head from up top, or a load of
buckshot scatterin’ out of the brush. Some of the
boys are awful careless. If you figger to stay round
here you better stay away from these ledges—and keep
out of caves—and don’t ask too many questions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“M-hm. I take it that this is a good place to keep
<i>still</i>.”</p>

<p>Her tongue made no answer; but her eyes narrowed
at the emphasis on the word “still.” He laughed
again and bent to freshen the fire.</p>

<p>When he had moved the sticks inward upon their
common focus and the flame was growing brighter and
hotter, he frowned at a canvas water-bag pendent from
a splinter of rock; thoughtfully eyed the girl’s inflamed
ankle and gashed arm; glanced at a small coffee-pot at
the edge of the blaze, and ran a hand through his light
hair. Then his face brightened. Rising, he rummaged
in a small bag of waterproof fabric, from which
he produced two flat tins of tobacco.</p>

<p>“Have to economize on water,” he said. “All I
own is in that cloth bucket, and the spring’s a deuce of
a distance down. Between bathing your arm and
making coffee and fixing your ankle—well, I just can’t
cook that ankle as it should be done. But I can draw
out most of the soreness with a tobacco poultice.
That’s what we’ll have to do.”</p>

<p>She eyed the two tins in his hand.</p>

<p>“Is that all the tobacco you’ve got?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. But it’s enough to do the trick.”</p>

<p>“Then what’ll you smoke? There ain’t any stores
here.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t smoke for awhile,” was the matter-of-fact
reply.</p>

<p>Dropping the cans beside her, he strode over to the
lantern and brought it and the gun to the overhanging
wall. Swiftly then he put coffee to boil, dipped a cupful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
of water from the canvas bag, flipped a clean white
handkerchief from the ditty-bag, and returned to her.
Without a word she let him inspect the lacerated arm.</p>

<p>“You got a nasty rip,” he stated, scowling. “Right
along the bone. How did you do it? Fall?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Her tone was more gentle now than it had
yet been, and her eyes dwelt on the sober face bending
over the injury. “I’ve—I’ve got a little secret up
here—a hole into the rocks that’s been my playhouse
since I was little, and when mom’s awful mean or pop’s
ugly drunk or—or I can’t stand it down there, I come
up here and stay all by my own self. This time I got to
dreamin’, I guess, and I went to sleep there. And
when I woke up it was night. Mebbe I’d ought
to have stayed there till mornin’, but I was awful
hungry, and I tried to git down the rocks and took a
fall.”</p>

<p>He nodded sympathetically, bathing the wound with
gentle touch.</p>

<p>“And then that mis’rable catamount had to smell
me. They’re awful bad when they’re hungry and
smell blood. I thought I was a goner till your light
showed. Who ever told you a catamount would run
if you said boo?”</p>

<p>“Somebody who didn’t know as much as he thought
he did, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I guess so too. They’ll run from a dog ’most
every time—even a little yippin’ yappin’ tarrier—and
mostly they’ll run from a man, but not always. If
they’ve kilt somethin’ or are jest goin’ to kill somethin’,
look out. And they’re ready to tear up a young ’un,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
or a hurt woman, any time. If you shoot ’em you’ve
got to kill ’em stone dead or they’ll rip you. Jonah
Hay, he kilt one last winter—shot it four times and
blew its jaw off and everything—and it lived long
enough to git to him and claw his legs terrible. Its
hide was longer than Jonah is himself, and Jonah
stands six foot.”</p>

<p>He nodded again, absorbed in his work but marveling
at her new friendliness. Now that she was talking,
she chattered as easily as if to an old friend.</p>

<p>“And there was Sam Codd—he went to chop wood
and run onto a little bobcat, nowheres near as big’s a
catamount. The critter had kilt a rabbit, and it come
at Sam, ready to jump right onto him. Sam, he
backed more’n a quarter of a mile through the snow,
holdin’ his axe ready to bust the critter, till he got to
his cabin. Then he jumped in and got his gun. But
by the time he come out the cat was gone back to the
rabbit, and when he got there the rabbit was et and
nothin’ left but blood and tracks.”</p>

<p>He desisted from his cleaning of the arm, which had
remained as stoically steady as if it were not in the
least tender. Tearing the edges of the big handkerchief,
he bound it around the injury and carefully
knotted the edge-strips. Then he turned to the coffee,
which now was steaming. In a moment he put a cupful
of the hot liquid in her hands and dumped the
grounds from the pot.</p>

<p>“Only one good cupful to a pot, but it’s strong
enough to knock you over,” he explained. “And I
need the pot now for your ankle. After the tobacco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
gets to drawing I’ll cook some grub and make more
coffee——”</p>

<p>He paused suddenly, staring at one of the tobacco-tins
he had picked up. Its blue revenue-paper seal
was broken.</p>

<p>“Now when did I open that can?” he puzzled,
turning up the lid. “I was sure these were fresh.
Confound it, it’s only half full!”</p>

<p>She made no answer. She blew on the coffee and
took a tentative sip.</p>

<p>“Ooh! It’s scaldin’ hot!”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Well, this other can’s full, anyhow.
Guess I can make out.”</p>

<p>While the fresh water came to a boil he squinted
repeatedly at the opened can, half rifled of its fragrant
brown slices. He did not see the impish glances she
threw at him. Nor, when he brought the hot water,
the tobacco, and more handkerchiefs, did he spy the
laughing light in the demurely downcast eyes.</p>

<p>With utmost care, though with necessary firmness,
he bound the hot-water-soaked slices around the
swollen ankle. Then he poured more hot water on
the bandages until, despite herself, she flinched and
drew up the foot.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, I reckon,” he said. “Lucky I have
plenty of handkerchiefs. That’s one thing I’m a crank
about—plenty of clean handkerchiefs and socks. Now
I’ll warm up some beans <i>a la</i> can.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want a smoke?” she teased.</p>

<p>“Well, since the tobacco’s all gone, I do,” he frankly
admitted. “However——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Then fill your pipe!” And from under the
blanket-edge she produced the missing slices.</p>

<p>“Well, you—you——” he stuttered.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you call me a dam-sell again, mister!
You stuff your pipe and have a good smoke.”</p>

<p>He scowled, grinned, laughed, produced a stubby
briar, and obeyed orders.</p>

<p>“I’ve a large mind to spank you,” he threatened,
between puffs. “But I never like to pick on a
cripple. So instead I’ll condemn you to stay here all
night.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” she countered serenely. “I’ve
made up my mind to stay anyway.”</p>

<p>He missed two puffs while he stared at her.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you’re showing sense,” he blurted.
“But what’s the reason for the sudden change of
heart?”</p>

<p>“You’re smokin’ the reason. ’Most any man round
here would have kilt that catamount. That’d be fun.
But none of ’em would use up his last smokin’ on a
woman—not if both her legs were busted. A feller
that would do that is worth trustin’.”</p>

<p>He threw up his hands.</p>

<p>“Talk about feminine logic! That beats ’em all,”
he laughed. “Well, fair dam—I beg pardon—young
woman, just who are you, if I may ask?”</p>

<p>The answer staggered him.</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’m only Nigger Nat’s girl.”</p>

<p>Over his pipe he blinked at her.</p>

<p>“My name’s Marry,” she went on. “Marry Oaks.
My whole name is Marryin’, but it’s Marry for short.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Marion,” he repeated absently. “But who’s Nigger
Nat? Not a colored man!”</p>

<p>The frank eyes looked steadily back at him.</p>

<p>“Why, yes he is. He’s yeller—half nigger. He’s
my pop. And mom’s part Injun.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>PIPE-SMOKE—AND POWDER-SMOKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> swept across the Shawangunks.</p>

<p>From the far-off crests of the Berkshires light
leaped athwart the silvery Hudson and smote the
frowning cliffs of the Great Wall of the Wallkill
Valley: a grim gray precipice stretching mile after
mile to the northeast, towering eight hundred feet
upward from the lower lands; unscalable, impenetrable
save at one small high gap—the Jaws of the
Traps, whence in other days the redskin had slipped
forth in bloody foray on the settlers below, and where
in turn the white man had lurked in retaliatory ambush.
Through that gap now wormed the sandy road
of the descendants of those pioneers, and along that
road at this early hour passed nothing more sinister
than dawn-sheen and morning breeze.</p>

<p>At the top of the crag-wall the light sped across the
forested gulf of the Traps itself, with its tiny scattered
farmhouses and its rocky clearings and mysterious
by-paths, to strike against more cliffs—the glacier-gouged
wall of Minnewaska, holding in its stony setting
a tiny jewel of an upland lake; and the fissured
butte of Dickie Barre, father of gigantic bowlders and
guardian of unknown caverns. And as the dayshine
flung itself against those forbidding ledges and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
fled on westward, the following breeze also threw
against them a wave of sound—the dry quacking
chorus of myriads of katydids.</p>

<p>All through the moonless September night those
queer insects had ground out their tuneless song, so
monotonous and so steady that the ears of other living
things had long since become dulled to it. But now,
swept by the dawn-wind in among the echoing crevices
and cañons, it seemed suddenly redoubled in volume.
Upon the senses of native bird and beast it made
slight impact, for they were well used to it; but on
the nerves of a long, blanketed figure lying in a narrow
passage between towering stone walls it struck like the
clatter of an alarm-clock. His towsled blond head
moved, his long-lashed lids lifted, and his blue eyes
darted about in inspection of his surroundings.</p>

<p>Beside his head lay a shotgun, its muzzle pointing
outward, its safety-catch off, ready for instant use.
Beyond the slit of an entrance showed nothing but
more rocks and a labyrinthine tangle of trees and
brush. Behind, the sheer wall of Dickie Barre alone
was visible across a roomy space open to the sky.
The only sounds were the everlasting quack of the
insects and the subdued <i>yarrup</i> of some invisible yellowhammer
flitting about in search for a breakfast.</p>

<p>He yawned, stretched, and sat up. The blanket
dropped from his chest, and he stared blankly at it.
Then his gaze shot toward the cliff beyond.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to be spanked hard, you little
bunch of wilfulness!” he muttered. “Sneaked in here
after I was asleep and spread this blanket over me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
didn’t you? And you needed both of ’em yourself—it’s
clammy up here at night. And walking on that
bad foot, too!”</p>

<p>But his eyes belied his growling tone as he arose
and tiptoed to the end of the passage. As they swept
the farther wall and dwelt on the little huddle of gray
blanket beside the charred embers of the fire they
softened still more. Obviously the girl muffled under
that stout sheet of wool was sleeping as peacefully on
her mattress of fragrant hemlock tips as if at home in
her own bed.</p>

<p>“These mountain girls are as tough as rawhide,” he
thought. “Imagine a city girl going through what she
did last night without a whine! And sleeping like that
under a rock. And——”</p>

<p>His hand strayed to a shirt pocket and fingered
some crumbled shreds of tobacco.</p>

<p>“And saving some smokes for me and stubbing
over here on a sprained ankle to give me half the
bedding. Would any of those flossy dolls in New York—or
Chi or San Fran or N’Orleans—do that?
Humph!”</p>

<p>Softly he stepped along the little shelf where last
night he had set lamp and gun; sank to a comfortable
squat, his back against the wall; filled and lit his pipe.
Thereafter he squatted a few minutes smoking and
musing.</p>

<p>“‘Nigger Nat’s girl,’” he thought. “Daddy a
drunken yellow mongrel, mother a hard-tongued half-breed.
How in thunder can a pair like that produce
such a witching wildcat as Marion Oaks? Her skin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
brown, but the brown is only sun-tan, or my eyes are
liars. And that hair and those eyes! How come?”</p>

<p>A flirt of active wings drew his gaze away for a
moment. On a limb of a plucky young pine growing
from the face of the cliff above, a pair of inquisitive
yellowhammers had paused to spy and gossip. Their
bright eyes peered knowingly downward, and as they
bobbed and bowed their restless heads the black crescents
under their creamy throats vied for notice with
the brilliant red splashes behind their crowns. Up
and down the branch they hopped, murmuring fussily
over this most scandalous event—a man and a girl
shamelessly occupying an outdoor boudoir, just as if
they were as free of convention as the birds themselves.
The man smiled up at them and waved a hand
in acknowledgment of their sharp scrutiny. Instantly
they winnowed away on whispering wings, to perch
again farther on and renew their eager watch.
Douglas resumed his puffing and puzzling.</p>

<p>“Must be a throwback of heredity,” he decided.
“There are such things as red-headed niggers. Saw
one in Detroit once. The white strain in her folks
cropped out strong when she was born. Must be
tough for a girl to be white and yet have the tainted
blood in her veins. No self-respecting white man
could marry her, of course. But it’s a dirty shame
that you have to be cursed by your ancestors, little
Miss Marion. You haven’t a chance. You’ll become
the ‘woman’ of some ignorant brute down below, and
before you’re thirty you’ll be old and gaunt and
broken-spirited.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>He flipped the ash from the top of his pipe-bowl and
puffed on.</p>

<p>“And yet your mind is that of a white girl—and a
thoroughbred, too,” he silently asserted. “The tobacco
and the blanket prove that. And you despise
your mongrel people. You run away up here to your
little secret ‘playhouse,’ and there you dream yourself
to sleep, as you did yesterday. And there’s poetry in
you, too. Let’s see, what was that you said—‘If all
the dead men here should rise they’d shake the hills
with their tramping!’”</p>

<p>His gaze grew absent, as through the smoke he
visioned an army of musket-bearing pioneers, shaggy-haired
and deerskin-clad, and of fierce-faced Indians
carrying bow and tomahawk, marching along the ancient
trails. They passed, those long-dead fighting
men, and in their wake strode whiskered mountaineers
of a later day, gripping shotgun and rifle, watching one
another in distrust—the victims of bullet and buckshot
hurled from the masking thickets of rhododendron,
the men who had died at the hands of their neighbors.
Crag and crevasse echoed to the tread of their ghostly
feet, and the cliffs quivered in unison. Out through
the Jaws of the Traps they swung into the eye of the
rising sun. The caverns ceased to echo. The man
found himself staring at a gray blanket and listening
to the rasping clack of the katydids.</p>

<p>With a long sigh he arose and knocked out his pipe
against his thigh.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” he muttered. “The past is past, the
present is here, and the future is rolling closer every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
minute. Poor little kid, with your dreams and your
picture-words! I’m sorry for you. But all I can do
is to cook some more grub for you and take you home.
Then we’ll each have to gang our ain gait.”</p>

<p>He moved toward the dead fire, still stepping softly.
But half-way across the rocky rubble he halted short,
struck by a sudden memory.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” he exclaimed. “I wonder if——”</p>

<p>Back into his mind had come a fragment of a tale
told months ago in New York by a chance acquaintance—a
man from up-State.</p>

<p>“Yessir,” he heard the voice saying, “there’s queer
things back in the hills—stories that’s never been
told much. These fellers I’m thinkin’ about, now:
they were the hardest crowd you’d ever want to meet.
They were bad whites and bad Indians and bad
niggers, all in this one gang and livin’ in back of a
long mountain wall with only one way into it. Outlaws?
Yessir, and worse’n that. Land pirates, I’d
call ’em. Cut your throat and never even wipe off the
knife afterward.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, they’d come out of this here hole-in-the-wall
I’m tellin’ about, and they’d waylay folks drivin’
along the roads, the rich folks in coaches and so on.
And they’d kill the men travelers and strip ’em clean.
And they’d carry off the women and hold ’em for
ransom. And if the ransom wasn’t paid the women
never got out. They had to stay there and be the
women of that gang. If they were extry good-lookin’
maybe they never got a chance to be ransomed.
More’n one fine lady went into that hole in the hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and never was heard of again. Yessir. That’s
right.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it was a long while ago. Good many
years before our time. After the Revolution, maybe—it
was pretty rough in lots of places round here
then, and these fellers could fight off a whole army by
guardin’ that gap of theirs. What ever become of ’em
I don’t know. But the descendants of that gang and
the women prisoners are livin’ there yet—outlaw white
blood and high-toned white blood and nigger and
Indian blood all mixed up together—and I’ve heard
tell that some of ’em are handsome, especially the
women. No, I never was in there myself——”</p>

<p>The memory-voice died and was lost. Vainly he
racked his brain for more of the tale. Where did that
man say the place was? In these Shawangunks?
Farther south in the Ramapos? Up north in the
Catskills, or far beyond in the Adirondacks? No answer
came. The rest of the story, its beginning and
end, were lost in the fog of many such chance conversations
at odd moments and in odd places.</p>

<p>But he was sure that the locale of that legend was
somewhere in the mountains of New York State. And
out there across the Traps was a long mountain wall
with but one way of entrance. And this girl’s father
and mother were of mongrel blood, and——</p>

<p>“By the Lord Harry, it fits!” he exclaimed aloud.
“If this isn’t the place it ought to be. And there’s
been a lady—a real, high-bred lady—in your family not
many generations ago, Miss Marion, or I’m a Chinaman!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>The surrounding rocks reverberated with his words.
The blanket before him moved quickly. Out from it
rose dancing gray eyes, glowing cheeks, and laughing
red lips.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Mister Detective!” she caroled. “Are
you talkin’ into your sleep, or did you find a drink
somewheres? You’re foolish, sounds like.”</p>

<p>Somewhat sheepish, he stood a moment without reply.
His eyes dwelt on the wealth of tumbled hair,
now glowing like forest-fire in the clean light of the
new day: no pale sandy tresses, but rich, vivid, Titian
red. Nowhere in it showed dark streak or telltale
kink.</p>

<p>“Listen,” he countered. “Did you ever hear of a
crowd of men—white and red and black—who went
out through the Gap over yonder and brought in
women and made slaves of them?”</p>

<p>At once her friendly face turned cold.</p>

<p>“You’re huntin’ into the wrong place,” she told
him, lifting her chin. “Our fellers don’t do that.
You better look somewheres else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks! Can’t you get rid of that idea that
I’m hunting somebody? These desperadoes were all
dead long before we were born. But haven’t you
heard some such story from the old folks?”</p>

<p>After watching his frank face a moment she shook
her head.</p>

<p>“No, never heard tell of such a thing. If they’re
all dead, what’s the good of worryin’ about ’em anyway?”</p>

<p>He shrugged and moved on toward the charred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
sticks, meanwhile turning the conversation into another
channel.</p>

<p>“How’s the ankle?”</p>

<p>She probed under the blanket, threw the covering
aside, pushed herself up, and took a tentative step.</p>

<p>“Why, by mighty, mister! You’re a reg’lar doctor!
It’s sore, but it ain’t half as bad as ’twas. It hurt terrible
last night when I——”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, but her eyes went to the entrance.</p>

<p>“When you came and covered me up? Serves you
right. That was the most foolish thing—but I thank
you, just the same.”</p>

<p>Her lips opened, but for a moment no word came.
Her eyes still were fixed on the narrow slit, and a little
frown of concentration furrowed her brow. He
pivoted and squinted against the glare of the rising
sun now darting in at that crack. Then she spoke—low
and tense.</p>

<p>“Where’s your gun? Layin’ there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Go git it!”</p>

<p>He sprang for the passage, where the weapon still
lay beside his discarded blanket. As he moved he heard
a badly balanced stone outside grate under the weight
of a moving body.</p>

<p>In a bounding rush he was across the open cavern
and between the bowlders. With a swoop he snatched
up his gun. His clutching hand closed with one finger
inside the trigger-guard.</p>

<p>Before he realized that he was pressing the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
curved lever, the gun jumped violently backward. A
thundering report smashed out. Powder-gas stung
his throat. The firearm fell with a sullen <i>clack</i> on the
stones beside his feet.</p>

<p>Vaguely his deafened ears received the echo of the
shot roaring along the farther wall of the Traps, a
mile away. He felt, rather than heard, something fall
among the rocks outside.</p>

<p>Grabbing the gun again, he slipped forward to the
entrance. At the corners of the upstanding bowlders
he halted short, staring at a huddled form which had
collapsed among the prone blocks beyond.</p>

<p>Only the head and upper torso of the stranger were
visible, his lower body and legs lying behind a slanting
stone. But clear in the sunlight showed a wan, pinched
young face, swarthy-skinned, with close-cropped black
hair. Along the stone under the head crept a red
trickle.</p>

<p>Suddenly Douglas was thrown aside. From behind
him Marion darted, wild-eyed. From her pale lips
broke a sharp cry: “Steve!”</p>

<p>Across the stones she struggled. Beside the youth
she dropped. Then she turned to Douglas a face
startling in its white wrath.</p>

<p>“You—murderin’—hound!” she choked. “You’ve
kilt him!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE FUGITIVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumb</span>, Douglas leaned his gun against the wall and
moved outward.</p>

<p>“Don’t you touch him!” blazed Marion. “Don’t
you put a hand onto him or I’ll—I’ll use that gun onto
you! I might have knowed you was lyin’—if I’d
knowed Steve was out I’d never trusted a word you
said. Now you’ve got him, leave him to be buried
where he was borned. Oh, Steve, Stevie lad! And
I—I give this feller the word to git his gun and do
for you! If I’d only knowed you was out! Oh, Stevie
boy!”</p>

<p>In a storm of grief she dropped her head on the thin
chest, hugging the limp lad to her with convulsive
strength. A few feet away the blond man halted,
dazed by the unintentional tragedy and the violence of
the girl’s outburst. For minutes he stood there motionless,
hardly grasping the significance of her denunciation.</p>

<p>Then his brain began to work. Her words, repeating
themselves, became appallingly plain. This young
Steve was “out”—and his swarthy pallor was not
merely that of unconsciousness or death: it was that
of long confinement in some place whence he had
just escaped—a place where hair was kept cropped.
And he, Douglas Hampton, who had been half accepted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
by this girl as the chance camper he claimed to
be, now had become in her mind a far blacker monster
than a mere “detective”—a merciless bloodhound who
killed poor fugitives on sight. Gazing miserably on
the mountain maid mourning her luckless boy lover,
he found the sight unendurable. His head drooped,
and his eyes rested unseeing on the stones between him
and the pathetic pair.</p>

<p>Up overhead fluttered the yellowhammers, scared by
the shot but emboldened by the ensuing silence to wheel
about and whet their curiosity in scrutiny of the tragic
group on the stones. High on the cliff behind, an unseen
squirrel fussed and fumed; and from crack and
cranny along the wall and from crevices among the
fallen fragments more than one furtive little eye
peered out. Steadily the sun slipped upward in the
clean blue sky, lighting up in pitiless nakedness one
more spectacle such as it had seen all too often in the
long stretch of time since men first penetrated into
this grim gulf. The wretched man neither heard nor
saw any of these things. Stone-still he stood, staring
down at a spattered splotch of white on a gray rock.</p>

<p>All at once his blank gaze focused sharply on that
white spot. He started. In one stride he was beside
the rock. As he stooped and squinted, a light flamed
in his face. With a bound he was up and leaping toward
the limp form beyond.</p>

<p>“Git away!” shrilled Marion, lifting a tear-swollen
face and turning on him like a tigress. “Keep your
bloody hands off him—he’s mine! My onliest——”</p>

<p>“Listen to me!” he commanded. “I never hit him!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
The shot struck that stone yonder—the whole charge!
It was an accident anyway—and he was out of line—the
shot couldn’t hit him from where I stood. Let me
see that wound.”</p>

<p>For an instant she sat rigid, unable to believe, yet
thrilled with hope. Quickly, but gently, he raised the
head of the youth and probed the injury he found.
Then he nodded vehemently.</p>

<p>“This is no gunshot wound,” he asserted. “It’s a
cut and a bump. He tumbled and knocked his head
against a stone. Got a hard crack, but nothing dangerous.
Poor kid, he looks half starved, and that smash
he took just finished him—for awhile. All he needs
is water, food, rest, and safety. I’ll give him all of
them.”</p>

<p>After one stare at the split scalp now turned toward
her, she sprang up, her cheeks aglow with joy. But
then she paused and shot a glance at the gun near
by.</p>

<p>“And you’ll take him back! No you won’t—I’ll——”</p>

<p>In the nick of time he caught her wrist as she
started toward the weapon.</p>

<p>“Take him back where?” he snapped. “I’ll take
him nowhere, except back among the rocks. After
he’s able to walk he can go where he likes. He’s
nothing to me. If he’s anything to you, don’t stand in
his way. I’m trying to help him. Now behave!”</p>

<p>She was tugging furiously away, but as he released
her she stood where she was, fighting now against her
distrust of him. He lifted the sagging body, got a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
firm grip, and lurched back toward the cliff. As he
passed the shot-scarred stone he grunted and jerked
his head downward toward it. Following, she paused
an instant and studied the white patch, glanced at the
little cañon, then moved on with clearer face. She
knew well how shot-marks looked; saw, too, that the
tall stranger had spoken truth when he said Steve was
out of his line of fire from the walled passage.
Though she had not seen the gun fired, she realized
now that hardly any man would have made so poor a
shot if he had actually been trying to hit the hunted
youth.</p>

<p>Yet, when Douglas edged into the slit and bore his
burden through, she halted behind him and put a
tentative hand on the gun, still loaded in one barrel.
Narrowly she inspected the “newfangled” weapon—so
unlike the ancient muzzle-loaders common in the
Traps—wavering between a desire to draw its remaining
charge and fear lest it might disastrously explode
again. After a dubious moment she shook her head
and went on. She must trust this man, whether she
would or not.</p>

<p>Down on the tumbled blanket and the bough-tip bed
Douglas laid the youth. Then he reached for the
canvas water-pail. Its lightness brought a frown to
his brow. Hardly a cupful remained in it.</p>

<p>“I’ll git somethin’,” she volunteered, reading his
thought. Before he could fathom her purpose she was
leaving through the passage, limping a little but moving
as if sure of herself. Presently she returned,
carefully bearing a jug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Well, you witch! Where did you dig up that?”</p>

<p>“That’s one of the questions you better not ask
round here,” she parried. “Jest hold up his head
while I give him a good snort.”</p>

<p>Smiling grimly, he raised the lad’s head and opened
his lax mouth while she pulled the corn-cob plug.
Deftly she put the nozzle to that mouth and poured
the “snort.” The aptness of the word was speedily
demonstrated by the uncouth noise which erupted
from Steve.</p>

<p>His eyes flew open, rolled, blinked. He coughed,
sprayed a mouthful of the colorless but powerful
liquor on his helpers, gasped, and struggled up as if
kicked out of sleep. Wildly he stared at the two faces
so near his. Then, as the girl put the jug again to his
mouth, he grabbed it with both hands and gulped
thirstily. When he lowered the vessel he licked his
lips, and across them flitted a faint grin.</p>

<p>“Gawd, am I dead or dreamin’?” he breathed
hoarsely. “Marry! Be ye there? An’ this here
licker—I’m a dunkey if ’tain’t real! Who—who’s this
feller?”</p>

<p>His brown eyes glared into the cool blue ones. Involuntarily
his right hand gripped the jug-handle as if
it were a gun-stock. His gaunt face tightened into a
menacing mask. He wavered like a mortally wounded
wildcat gathering its last strength to spring.</p>

<p>“I’m all right, Steve,” soothed Douglas. “I’m not
after you. You’re safe, and this is Marry, and that’s
real stuff in the jug. Calm down.”</p>

<p>Under the steadying influence of the quiet tone the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
youth relaxed a little. Yet his lined mouth remained
set as he demanded: “Who shot at me?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” Douglas told him. “My gun exploded
accidentally. I didn’t even see you. You fell and
cracked your head.”</p>

<p>The boy still glowered suspiciously, but when
Marion spoke his gaze shifted to her.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Steve. You’re all right, ’cept a little
cut and a bump. Tell me quick—how long you been
out? Are they after you?”</p>

<p>A savage smile twisted the thin mouth.</p>

<p>“I dunno if they’re trackin’ me—I reckon so. I
ain’t seen ’em. I got ’way Monday night, an’ I ain’t
goin’ back till I git Snake Sanders. Cuss him, he put
me away—an’ I never done it, Marry, I never! It
was Snake done it! An’ I got the blame. Three years
I been doin’ time—but I’ll take them three years outen
him quick’s I git to a gun! Yas, an’ all the rest of
his life too! I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you! He’ll git you, not you git him. You
might’s well try to git a copperhead by grabbin’ onto
him with your bare hands. And you’ve got to keep
out till the officers quit huntin’—they’ll be into here,
if they ain’t here now. Don’t you go near the house
or a gun—don’t move or make a noise till I tell you,
or you’re a goner! Now gimme that jug and I’ll put
it back. We’ve got to go quick to some other hide-out—there’s
been shootin’ up here and we don’t know
who’ll come—gimme that jug!”</p>

<p>“Not till I git ’nother big snort under my shirt,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
refused Steve, lifting the jug in unsteady hands. “I
ain’t et much for four days, an’——”</p>

<p>“Gimme that jug!” she stormed. “Know whose
it is? Snake’s!”</p>

<p>The boy started as if stung. His grip relaxed, and
she yanked the jug from him and grabbed up the
corn-cob. Douglas noticed, in an absent way, that the
clay was smeared with a streak of green paint.</p>

<p>“Snake’s? I been drinkin’ that varmint’s licker?”
raged Steve. “I’d ruther lap up p’ison! Gimme that
jug back! I’ll bust it!”</p>

<p>“No you won’t!” She backed off. “He’s right
round here now somewheres, I shouldn’t wonder,
a-sneakin’ and a-slidin’ along, and you’ve got to lay low
awhile—you ain’t even got a gun. I’m goin’ to put this
right back where ’twas. You keep quiet.”</p>

<p>She hobbled away. Steve struggled to rise and
overtake her, but found himself powerless in the grip
of Douglas.</p>

<p>“Cool off, Steve,” advised the blond man. “Think
what a joke this is on Snake—you drinking up his
licker. Wouldn’t it make him mad?”</p>

<p>A sudden hard grin split the pallid face. Steve sank
back.</p>

<p>“That’s right, too—uh—what’s yer name?”</p>

<p>“Call me Hamp.”</p>

<p>“Hamp. Good ’nough. I dunno ye, an’ ye don’t
b’long round here, but ye act right. Got anything to
eat, Hamp? I been goin’ a long time, an’ it’s ’most
took the tuck outen me.”</p>

<p>He began to blink a little uncertainly. The “licker”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
was fast getting in its work on his woefully empty
stomach.</p>

<p>“Got a can of beans and some water, and they’re
yours.”</p>

<p>“Gimme ’em!”</p>

<p>The demand crackled like an electric spark. The
hard-set visage turned ravenous, and the wiry frame
lifted itself and set its back against the wall. When
Douglas tendered the opened can it was snatched and
a quarter of its contents dumped into a grimy hand.
An instant later the whole handful had been wolfed
down and another was being stuffed into a fast-working
mouth. When Marion came limping back from
her mysterious pilgrimage only an empty tin and greasy
lips remained to tell what had happened.</p>

<p>Unspeaking, the blond man opened another bean-can,
put in a tin spoon, and handed it to the girl. She
sank on a stone and began eating eagerly, but far more
daintily than the boy. Douglas watched silently, but
he nodded as he noted the instinctive difference in her
way of feeding herself. Steve also watched, but with
a different thought.</p>

<p>“Marry, ye’re gittin’ awful purty,” he vouchsafed.
“When I went ’way ye was thin’s a rail, but now
ye’re han’some as a little red wagon. Ain’t ye got a
kiss for me?”</p>

<p>“Not till you wash your face, you dirty thing,” she
composedly answered. He grinned and wiped his
mouth on a tattered sleeve much too big for him.
“Where’d you git the clothes?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Them?” He glanced down at threadbare coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
thin shirt, and ragged overalls. “Found ’em into
fellers’ barns down yender. Hid my pen-clo’es into
one feller’s hay. Purty smart, hey?”</p>

<p>“Smart! Don’t you know the officers’ll track you
that way? They will, sure’s you’re livin’.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have a job findin’ me now I’ve got here,”
he muttered, though plainly disconcerted. “’Less’n
somebody blabs.”</p>

<p>Brown eyes and gray eyes switched to the quiet man
who sat taking it all in.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said he. “I haven’t seen you folks
at all—either of you.”</p>

<p>After a narrow stare Steve nodded slightly. Not
another word was spoken until the meagre meal was
finished and the water-bag was totally empty. Then
Marion took command of the situation.</p>

<p>“We’ll be goin’ now,” she stated, rising. “No,
don’t come with us. Steve and me, we’ll go ’long by
our own selves, and then you won’t know what’s
’come of us if anybody should ask you. We’re awful
obliged to you, stranger, and we wish you good luck.
G’by.”</p>

<p>“I’m not saying good-bye. I’m staying here, as I
told you before. Maybe we’ll meet again.”</p>

<p>She took several halting steps outward before responding,
Steve trailing silently behind her. At the
edge of the cañon she paused and spoke over one
shoulder.</p>

<p>“If you’re stayin’, don’t stay <i>here</i>. It’s no place
for you. You’ll be better off down below. There’s
Jake Dalton’s place, down towards the Clove, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
nobody lives any more, and you could go into there
and live pretty safe and comf’table if you mind your
own business—and if the ha’nt don’t git you.”</p>

<p>“Oho! A haunted house!”</p>

<p>“So folks say. Jake, he got kilt last spring by
somethin’—nobody knows what. They found him
after he’d been dead a week or so, and they couldn’t
look at him right close. But he wasn’t shot or cut or
clawed—he was jest swelled up terrible. Two or
three fellers stayed into his house since, and they got
drove out—somethin’ was there that they didn’t see,
but they could hear it and <i>feel</i> it. Some say it’s Jake’s
ha’nt. Others say it ain’t Jake but the thing that kilt
him. If you want to try livin’ there nobody’s likely
to bother you much. It sets on the left of the
Clove road, down yonder, with two big pines back of
it.</p>

<p>“Now we’re goin’. Oh, and one other thing—you
better not come round Nigger Nat’s house. He ain’t
sociable. G’by.”</p>

<p>Out through the crack they passed. For a minute
or two the blond man sat looking moodily at the exit.
Then he arose and followed.</p>

<p>The rocks outside were vacant. The trees and undergrowth
showed no sign of life. Even the curious
yellowhammers were gone. Nowhere, except on two
stones—one scarred by shot, one stained with blood—was
anything to show that since the last sunset two
young hill-folk had come suddenly into the life of
Douglas Hampton and as swiftly vanished from it.</p>

<p>“Well,” he muttered, picking up his gun and turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
back, “Steve, you tough young wolf, you don’t
know how lucky you are. I only hope you’ll treat her
right in the years to come.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>CREEPING THINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> on the brink of Dickie Barre, on a triangular
outcrop of stone bare of brush but topped by whispering
pines, Douglas lounged in luxurious content, basking
in the mellow warmth of September sun.</p>

<p>Behind him his pack leaned against the base of a
pine. Beside him lay his gun. Before him stretched
the long panorama of the Traps.</p>

<p>From the half-naked rock of Millbrook Mountain,
where the rim of the great bowl curved westward to
merge into the Minnewaska steeps, to the castle-like
peak of Sky Top, beneath which the strange lake of
Mohonk nestled out of sight in a cup of sheer stone,
rambled the top of the Great Wall. Northward from
Sky Top it dipped downward in a long sweep, and
there the east-swinging wall of Dickie Barre seemed
to close in and complete the unbroken ring of uplands
surrounding the forested chasm. But the man
loafing up on the breezy point knew that such was not
the case.</p>

<p>Though he had not yet traveled in that direction,
he had been studying a couple of squares of Government
topographic map, of which several were in his
ditty-bag; and he knew that the walls did not close.
They pinched together into a narrow ravine, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
veered apart again, each pursuing its own way into
the north until it became only a series of rounded
knolls sinking into the other low hills beyond. And
that ravine, or perhaps the wider valley floor beyond,
must be the Clove of which Marion Oaks had spoken.</p>

<p>Through that ravine and on into the north, the map
said, ran a road—the inside road of the Traps; and
along that road-line, at wide intervals, were the little
square symbols which, to the topographer, signify
“houses.” One of those dots must be the house where
Jake Dalton had lived before he was found “swelled
up terrible”; where now even the hard sons of the
craggy hills dared not sleep because of the fearful
thing which could not be seen but could be felt. Before
sundown, the lone blond man intended, he would
find that house and see whether it was fit for habitation.
If so, he meant to inhabit it, ha’nt or no ha’nt.</p>

<p>Everything impelled him toward that house. To
live continuously among the bowlders where he had
stayed last night was neither comfortable nor sensible:
the place was too far from water, from food,
from human associates; and when the drenching fall
rains should come, as they might at any time, he would
be almost unprotected. For sinister purposes, for the
concealment of nameless activities and of wanted men,
the maze of cliff-blocks was ideal; but for the steady
residence of a man who dodged neither lawmakers
nor lawbreakers it was the reverse. And to a red-blooded,
two-handed fellow like Douglas Hampton the
story of the uncanny house was enough. Had it been
an even poorer place than his rocky lair, he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
have journeyed thither to seek the solution of its mystery.</p>

<p>But the day was far from old, and there was time
to loaf and look and bask and think, unworried by
necessity. Here was none of the rush and drive of
the city, the scurry to fill assignments, the fret and
fume of the hordes of business-slaves hurtling over-ground
and underground in ant-like activity. Here
was nothing to do but relax, absorbing the golden sunlight
and the green beauty of nature and the clinking
music of unseen hammers far below and far away on
the Mohonk slope, where millstone-makers were rifting
rock in their little quarries. What though one had
no habitation? What though his food was almost gone
and the pipe dangling from the corner of his mouth
was empty? Time enough to seek shelter when night
approached; time enough to rustle for food when the
last crumb had vanished. Now was the hour to let
his city-starved soul feast on freedom.</p>

<p>So he leaned there on an elbow, blinking outward
and downward at the varying verdure of the hardwood
forests, the red spots of sumach and the orange
tips of goldenrod brightening the little fields, the tiny
houses dotting the openings, the little ribbons of smoke
drifting away from their chimneys. His thoughts
moved in a slow circle—from Marion to Steve, from
Steve to the haunted house, from the haunted house
to the legend of the long-dead outlaw gang, from the
gang to its women prisoners, and so back again to
Marion. Where was she now? Down in one of those
houses, beaten and sworn at for running away? Much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
nearer, still talking with her escaped-convict lover in
the “hide-out” to which she had taken him? Limping
along somewhere in the masking brush, forgetful of
pain, thinking only of bringing food to the worn-out
fugitive? Only the labyrinth below could tell; and it
was not in the habit of telling tales about its children.</p>

<p>And this Snake Sanders, who had wriggled out of
the way of officers and let a boy suffer the penalty of
some unknown crime—who and what was he? The
thinker, accustomed to studying faces and voices, felt
that Steve’s denial of guilt and denunciation of Snake
were genuine. His virulent hatred, his vicious threat
against that man, were those of the bitterly wronged.
Yet Marion, herself swift-tempered and courageous,
had shown that she feared this Snake, who might be
a-sneakin’ and a-slidin’ along near at hand——</p>

<p>The blond man grew tense. Something <i>was</i> sneaking
along, though not very near. Something was
creeping stealthily toward him from the thick growth
behind; something which made no footfall, but which
caused a slight difference in the rustling of the breeze-kissed
leaves.</p>

<p>He started to turn his head, then checked the movement.
He felt that he would see nothing: that the
creature was traveling with Indian stealth, keeping
itself masked; that his look behind would only warn
the sinister thing that its approach was known. He
was lying dangerously close to the edge, and his nerves
shouted to him to get back while there was time. But
he held himself where he was.</p>

<p>His eyes flicked downward at his gun. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
carelessly raised himself to a sitting position, took his
pipe from his mouth and glanced at it, put it back,
and let his hand stray down to his shirt pocket. It
hovered there a moment, then sank loosely as if
empty. But cupped in his palm now was a little round
mirror.</p>

<p>Casual though his movements had been, the soft
rustle of progress had ceased. Only the little flutterings
caused by wandering air-currents came to him.
As he sat still, however, apparently absorbed in contemplation
of the scene below, it recommenced.
Slowly, imperceptibly, he turned his hand, slanting
the mirror up and down by degrees, watching it from
the corner of his eye. It was a schoolboy trick which
he had used more than once in later years when desirous
of seeing something behind without turning his
head. And now, listening keenly and moving the telltale
glass with practised hand, he soon located the advancing
thing behind the pine, some ten feet away,
where his pack lay.</p>

<p>It was creeping now on the ground, free from the
brush beyond but still unseen; keeping itself concealed
behind pack and pine, making only a slight slither as it
came. The sound died. For a long minute all was
quiet. Then, slowly, above the edge of the pack rose
a hat.</p>

<p>Shapeless, dingy felt it was, with a ragged hole
below its crown. Under its brim glimmered black
eyes, beady and cold as those of a reptile. Little by
little the nose came up into view—a flat, wide nose
with something of the triangularity of a snake’s head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
There it poised, mouth and jaw hidden behind the bulk
of the pack.</p>

<p>The opaque eyes fixed greedily on the new shotgun
lying beside the watcher’s leg. Then they returned to
the back and shoulders of the blond man, and the lids
narrowed into wicked slits. The nose drew downward,
the eyes followed, the hat faded. Above the
pack nothing showed except the low branches of the
pine.</p>

<p>Little sounds of movement came—of movement but
not of advance. Douglas moved the mirror to
right and left of the lump of blankets. His fingers
grew rigid. Something had appeared beside the
pack—a light but strong box, from which a dirty
black-haired hand was lifting a lid. As that lid arose
the box was tilted so that its top became an open
side, facing toward the man on the brink. And out
from it crawled a big copperhead.</p>

<p>Head raised, it glided forward a foot or two and
stopped, its tail still in the box, which lay motionless.
Its venomous eyes focused on the still figure of the
man beyond, who remained as rigid as the rock on
which he sat. Its tongue ran out and vibrated in menace.
Slowly it slipped forward a little farther, then
paused again. Douglas braced himself to snatch up
his gun, whirl, and fire the instant its approach was
resumed. But it was not resumed.</p>

<p>Instead, the repulsive creature lay quiet, absorbing
the warmth of rock and sun. Minutes passed, and it
made no move. Then from beyond the pack came a
faint sibilant sound—an almost inaudible noise which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
was not hiss nor breath nor whistle, but something
of all three, and which seemed to arouse the reptile.
It turned, and crept sluggishly toward the spot whence
the sound had come.</p>

<p>Twice that indescribable sibilance was repeated, and
the snake moved on in its deliberate, fat-bodied way.
Just then a sudden gust of wind swooped playfully
along the brink, startling the leaves into a flapping
chorus like the beating wings of trapped birds. The
hideous thing on the ground slid around the pack,
paused, was gone.</p>

<p>Douglas drew a long breath and became aware that
his shirt was clammy with cold perspiration. A chill
shivered down his back. Moving the glass, he
scanned all around and above that pack. Nothing
showed. The gust of wind fled along on its frolicsome
way, and all grew quiet. No sound came from behind
the pine.</p>

<p>Still controlling his movements, he looked casually
around, then arose as if tired of sitting. As he stood
up, however, his gun was in one hand, and he loosely
swung its twin muzzles to cover the pack. Feigning
a yawn, he stepped lazily toward the pine, dropping
the mirror into a trousers pocket as he moved. With
a quiet click his safety-catch slid, and two solid
charges—of buckshot—were ready for instant use.</p>

<p>A good stride away from the blankets he turned
aside and drifted around the butt of the pine. Then
he halted, sorely puzzled. The man who should have
been lurking there was not. The box, too, had vanished.
Not even the snake——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>But yes, the snake was there. It was curled just
below and behind the pack, hidden from any eye except
one searching for it; three feet of silent death,
ready to strike its fangs into the hands of the man
stooping to lift his back-burden before slinging it on
his shoulders. Even now, with that man’s eye on it, it
was poising in venomous alertness, its tongue vibrating
again like a blur.</p>

<p>Douglas stepped onward a little, lifted his gun,
and fired. The snake rolled writhing away, blown
apart. Instantly he wheeled, the other barrel ready
to meet any menace. But still nothing showed itself.
The growth beyond seemed empty.</p>

<p>Warily watching, he stepped to his pack, swung it
up one-handed, and stood a minute longer scanning
his surroundings. Seeing nothing new, he got into
the straps and strode away. Only a few rods to his
left, he knew, ran a faint trail—the path by which he
had come here after finding a steep slope which had
enabled him to climb Dickie Barre. The trail would
be empty, of course; the skulking assassin in the felt
hat would be so cunningly hidden in the encompassing
tangle that no mere stranger could find him. No
use hunting him.</p>

<p>But as he emerged into that path he stopped, startled.
There, only a few feet away, stood the man.</p>

<p>So astounded by the other’s audacity was Douglas
that he stood gaping. The sinister hillman grinned
guilelessly.</p>

<p>“Howdy, stranger!” he greeted. “Scairt ye, did
I? Was that ye a-shootin’ jest now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Douglas swallowed an impulse to leap at him. Still
amazed, he glanced rapidly over him. Below the
ophidian eyes and flat nose which he had seen before,
he now noted a coarse mouth, tobacco-yellowed teeth,
scraggly black beard about a week old, long lean frame,
and nondescript garments. His curving hands were
empty. His snake-box was not with him now. Nor
had he any gun.</p>

<p>The man moved slightly, shifting a foot. In the
movement was something reptilian—a sinuous smoothness
that was serpentine. And in the short sentences
which he had just spoken was a repellent hiss.</p>

<p>“Howdy yourself!” growled Douglas. “What are
you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Jest a-ramblin’ round, stranger. Might ast ye the
same. What was ye shootin’?”</p>

<p>“Snake.” Douglas gave him a hard look.</p>

<p>“Yeh? Huh! Awful waste o’ powder. Us fellers
use sticks onto them things. Thought mebbe ye got
what ye’re into here for.”</p>

<p>A cunning wink followed his last utterance.</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>The yellow teeth bared themselves in a wide, silent
laugh. But the beady eyes held no mirth.</p>

<p>“Think I dunno ye? Huh! I ain’t no fool. Ye
ain’t here jest to look at rocks an’ things. Trouble is,
ye dunno this kentry an’ how to work it. None o’ ye
do. Everybody into the place knowed days ago ye
was here, an’ ye’ll never git yer man ’less’n ye do business.
I’m the feller to do business with.”</p>

<p>Again the cunning wink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Meaning?” repeated Douglas.</p>

<p>“Huh! Ye know. We’ll work shares. I’ll toll yer
man to ye for half the reward. Who d’ye want?
How much’s he wuth?”</p>

<p>The blond man bit back a sudden desire to grin.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he countered.</p>

<p>“Me? Snake Sanders.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE KNOCK-OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas</span> deliberately swung the pack from his back
and dropped it. Against it he leaned his gun, making
sure, as he did so, that he had restored the safety-lock.
As he faced Snake Sanders he caught the black eyes
fixed again on the weapon, and in them glinted the
same light of cupidity which had been there before.</p>

<p>“Right purty gun ye’ve got, stranger,” Snake
admired. “Don’t look sensible, though, without no
hammers onto it. What’s one o’ them guns cost?”</p>

<p>“Oh, several dollars. But what about this business
of yours?”</p>

<p>“It’s like I tell ye.” Snake dragged his gaze away
from the shotgun. “Do business with me an’ ye’ll git
what ye want. Otherways ye git nothin’—but trouble.”</p>

<p>“So? And who’ll make the trouble? You?”</p>

<p>“Me? Huh! I don’t have to. Ye’ll jest fall into
it.”</p>

<p>“Fall into it. Sure it won’t come crawling up on
me from behind?”</p>

<p>The black lashes flickered.</p>

<p>“What ye mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Your name’s Snake.”</p>

<p>Sanders’ beady stare beat into his inscrutable face.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Presently the serpentine man grinned and subtly relaxed.</p>

<p>“Names don’t hurt. Think I’d try to do ye after I
got my money, mebbe? That ain’t my way, stranger.
Folks calls me Snake ’cause I can handle snakes.
They don’t never bite me. I can tromp right round
’em into my bare feet, an’ pick ’em up into my bare
hands, an’ they lemme alone. I can talk to ’em—snake
talk—an’ they mind. If I’d of been over yender
’fore ye kilt that snake o’ yourn, now, I could have
sent him away jest by talkin’ to him.”</p>

<p>His gaze never wavered as he talked. He gave no
sign of guilt. Unaware that he had been observed in
the little round mirror, he was sure there was nothing
to connect him in this man’s mind with the fact that
a copperhead had lurked beside the pack, and he was
bold enough to make capital of the presence of that
reptile. Evidently he was proud both of his name
and his diabolical gift.</p>

<p>“Ye must have hearn o’ me,” he went on. “I’ve
done business before. Nobody round here knows it,
o’ course. I keep my tracks covered. But they must
have told ye outside ’bout Snake Sanders. I’m him.”</p>

<p>Douglas kept the disgust out of his face. He wanted
to know just how deep was this man’s duplicity.
He had not yet learned that it was absolutely bottomless.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard the name. People around here don’t
monkey with you much, do they?”</p>

<p>A hissing laugh came through the yellow teeth, and
for once the eyes showed a glint of amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“No they don’t. I’ve got this hull place right into
my hand, mister. Folks step wide o’ me. Some fellers
has got brash an’ throwed buckshot at me, but
they don’t no more. They’re dead. Others has
learnt.”</p>

<p>“I see. Those fellows stepped on snakes, maybe?”</p>

<p>“Mebbe. I ain’t sayin’. But come on, stranger, we
can’t talk here all day. Who d’ye want? How
much?”</p>

<p>“I think,” was the slow answer, “that the party I’m
interested in just now is out of reach.”</p>

<p>Snake looked blank. Reaching smoothly into a
pocket, he drew out a plug of tobacco, bit off a chunk,
and chewed.</p>

<p>“Got away clean, ye mean. Ain’t into here nowheres?
Huh! Don’t be too sure. There’s lots o’
hide-outs into here that ye dunno ’bout. I know ’em.
I can git anybody—man, woman, or chile. An’ there’s
more’n one way to skin a skunk. If yer man ain’t
too well knowed, why won’t ’nother man do?”</p>

<p>Again the insinuating wink.</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>“Aw, come off! Ye know. Fix it onto some feller
we can git. Take him out, fix up yer case, railroad
him an’ git yer money. Think I dunno how you
detectives work? Ye must think I’m simple. It’s
done right ’long—grab a feller that ain’t got no friends
an’ send him up. What chance has a feller here got
when he gits drug into the courts outside? Puh!”
He expectorated profusely and waited.</p>

<p>Douglas laughed out in contempt. He took a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of slow strides forward. Snake shifted again, and his
eyes narrowed once more.</p>

<p>“You’re barking up the wrong tree,” the blond man
derided. “I’m no detective. I’m hunting nobody.
I’m in here for—my health. See?”</p>

<p>Snake saw—or thought he did. Instantly he
changed front.</p>

<p>“I knowed it. Ye needn’t jump onto me, now. I
was jest a-tryin’ ye out. If ye was a real detective
ye’d be down snoopin’ round houses, not a-hidin’ out
up here. Wal, ye come to the right place, stranger.
Where ye from? What’d ye do? Go on, tell a feller.
I’ll keep it dark. Got money, o’ course. Gimme some
an’ I’ll fetch ye all the feed ye want.”</p>

<p>“And fetch the officers along too, when they
come.”</p>

<p>“Aw no. That talk I jest give ye was all moonshine—not
a true word into it. I was jest makin’ sure
o’ ye, I tell ye. Now I know ye I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” Hampton’s anger broke out. “I’ve
been making sure of you, too. You’re a liar. You’re
a treacherous sneak. You’d sell a hunted man to me—you’d
sell an innocent man to me—you’d sell me, too.
You think I’m after somebody, eh? Well, you’re right.
I’m after the man who thought he was going to get
my gun and money, the man who didn’t get them and
is trying to trap me now, the man who sneaked up and
let that copperhead out of the box! I’m after Snake
Sanders! And I’ve got him!”</p>

<p>So rapid had been his words, so swift was his following
leap, that Snake stood flat-footed as a big fist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
smacked into his face. He was knocked headlong
backward.</p>

<p>Into the bushes he sprawled with a crash of breaking
branch and twig. Into the bushes Douglas jumped
after him. But Sanders, though dazed by the impact
of the blow and the shock of finding himself caught,
was neither senseless nor helpless. He wriggled over
and seemed to curve upward. Head-first, like a striking
reptile, he threw himself at the legs of the man
above. His punisher lurched over him and fell.</p>

<p>Snake’s lean frame wriggled forward again and
started up. But he was not quite free. Without
waiting to rise, Douglas darted a hand backward and
clamped it around one bare ankle. Holding his grip,
he rolled over, twisting and yanking the trapped leg.</p>

<p>The hillman tottered and lost his footing. But even
before he hit the ground for the second time he lashed
out in air with his free foot. His heel thumped into
the blond man’s face, snapping his head back like a
fist-blow. Hissing furiously, Snake jerked up his leg
and let drive again. The fierce foot-punch missed this
time, for its mark had ducked aside and the leg shot
over Douglas’ shoulder. Promptly it was seized, held,
forced down.</p>

<p>Both men now were in a grotesque posture for fighting.
Snake’s legs were spread, with his antagonist
sitting between them and clutching a foot on each side,
while Snake himself sat on one booted ankle, pinning
it down. But the advantage was decidedly with
Sanders, for both his hands were free. He shot them
straight for the other’s throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>His arms were struck up and his savage clutch
failed. His feet were freed, but the hands which had
gripped them now were fists, shooting short-arm jolts
into his jaw. And, short though those blows were,
they crunched his teeth together with a force that made
him blink groggily and throw himself aside.</p>

<p>An instant later he found himself grappled. Douglas
was clinching him, shoving him down, striving for a
leg-hold with his knees and relentlessly forcing one
of his arms up behind his back. Douglas’ eyes were
ablaze with wrath and his jaw set like a rock. Now
he had this treacherous reptile in a real grip, and he
meant to smash it. And Snake, reading the grim
purpose in the face of the man against whose back he
had loosed creeping death, felt fear stab through
him.</p>

<p>Heretofore the sinister hillman had fought only in
a flurry of surprise and rage—though he would not
have neglected to make his work complete if once he
got the upper hand. Now the fury of desperation
fired him. He snaked himself over sidewise, wriggled
a leg loose, twined it around the booted leg beside it,
and, by a curling twist, eased the strain on his pinioned
arm. His yellow fangs fixed themselves in his enemy’s
shoulder. His free hand clawed for the blue eyes.</p>

<p>Douglas released his arm-hold, evaded the gouging
nails by a backward jerk of the head, got both hands
to his foe’s throat, tore him loose. Both scrambled to
their knees and up on their feet. Both struck with
savage fists at the same instant. Both blows landed.</p>

<p>Squarely between the eyes Snake’s knotty fist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
cracked. Douglas saw a red flash, followed by floating
rings of flame. His own knuckles tingled from
their impact with a bristly chin. Vaguely he saw the
face beyond the wavering fire-spots fade backward.
His other fist, swinging for it, hit nothing.</p>

<p>For an instant he dug his knuckles into his eyes,
trying to clear his sight. Then he squinted around.
Snake was down again, clawing at the ground, trying
to rise. He jumped for him—stubbed a toe against
an unnoticed rock—stumbled and sprawled.</p>

<p>As he pushed himself up, raging, Snake got to his
haunches and lurched at him in a clinch. Douglas
threw himself into the wiry arms and grappled for a
hold of his own. And then for a few minutes it was
a straining, kicking, punching rough-and-tumble, each
fighting with all he had.</p>

<p>Again and again each secured a throat-hold but
lost it. Over they rolled, kicking whenever a foot
came free, slugging with either fist or both, striving
to dash each other’s head against stone or root, heaving
and wrenching until they had tumbled out of the
brush and into the trail where they had first stood.
In Douglas grew amazement at the strength and endurance
of his antagonist. In Snake’s brain gnawed
a keener fear of the man on whom he had exhausted
in vain every foul trick he knew. Neither could quite
overcome the other. Both were gasping and growing
dizzy from the violence of their combat. And they
fought on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in a final squirming spasm, Snake twisted
himself free. Before Douglas could clutch him again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
he had rolled away and was shoving himself up. The
blond man got his feet under him and pitched to a
stand. Then, too short of breath to renew the duel at
once, they balanced themselves and glowered.</p>

<p>Snake was a hard sight, and Douglas was not much
better. The hillman’s face was gashed by cuts and
smeared with mingled blood and tobacco-juice, his
right eye was shut, his mouth was a blubbery pulp, his
clothes hung in rags. The other’s bloodshot eyes
gleamed between puffy lids, his nose leaked a red
drizzle, his light hair was stained from a cut scalp and
full of dirt, his shirt was ripped to the waist and
crimsoned at the shoulder where Snake’s teeth had
sunk. But neither saw anything except the menace
in the other’s eyes.</p>

<p>The same thought came to both—probably born in
the vindictive brain of Snake and involuntarily transmitted
by his look: the thought of the gun leaning
against the pack. True, it was “newfangled,” and
Douglas knew it was locked against discharge; but in
a fight a gun is not only a gun but a steel bar and a
club. It was behind its owner, and a swift dash past
him might make Snake its master. He attempted the
dash.</p>

<p>Without the slightest preliminary movement he was
speeding past Douglas. But the latter was not asleep.
Pivoting on a heel, he swung a round-arm blow flush
under the passing jaw.</p>

<p>The shock was terrific. Between the impetus of
Snake’s plunge and the body-drive of the punch, the
impact was more than doubled. The slugging arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
dropped, numb to the shoulder. Snake also dropped—numb
all over.</p>

<p>His feet left the ground, and he straightened backward
in the air. Flat on his back he struck, arms at
his sides, legs stretched nerveless, head a little to the
right, blank face turned to the brush. There he lay
without a quiver of life.</p>

<p>Douglas stood peering down, slowly swinging his
numbed arm at his side. Minutes passed. His breathing
grew normal; his arm lost its wooden feeling.
Somewhere a bird chirped noisily. Up from the unseen
chasm of the Traps idled a new breeze, bearing
the music of the far-off hammers. The warm sun
beat down on the two men. Still Snake Sanders lay
motionless.</p>

<p>The swollen-eyed man above him trod tentatively
on a grimy hand. It gave no answering twitch. He
stooped, studied the face, put a thumb on the left lid,
pushed it up, and peered at the eyeball. Then he
stood up, unconsciously rubbing his thumb against his
shirt.</p>

<p>“Well, Mister Snake Sanders,” he said grimly, “if
I were you and you were I, you’d drag me over to the
edge and pitch me off to smash on the rocks, most
likely. That’s what I ought to do to you. But I don’t
happen to be built along those lines. Just what can a
white man do with a reptile like you under such circumstances?”</p>

<p>The problem remained unanswered, though he ran a
hand repeatedly through his thick hair and frowned
down at the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“If I could only have hit you harder, maybe you’d
die of a broken neck,” he mused. “I’ve known such
things to happen. But I did the best I could, and
you’ll live just the same. The devil takes care of his
own, anyway.”</p>

<p>Slowly he turned and walked to his pack. Deliberately
he got into the straps, wincing as the injured
shoulder came under pressure.</p>

<p>“Must wash that place well when I reach the creek,”
he muttered, “or I’ll get blood-poisoning. Guess a
complete bath wouldn’t be inappropriate.”</p>

<p>He settled the pack, gripped his gun, stepped to the
edge of the brush, and picked up his hat. Then he
looked again at the silent Snake.</p>

<p>“On the whole, I think I have a good deal the best
of it,” he declared. “Your little copperhead trick did
me no harm, and I know a lot more now than if you
hadn’t tried it. Yes, a whole lot. As for damages to
our respective complexions and temperaments, I’m no
worse off than you; and in the matter of general condition
you’re certainly much worse than I. So we’ll
call it quits—for the present.”</p>

<p>He plodded away. But after a few steps he looked
back with a hard smile.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he concluded, “I was forgetting. Our
young friend Steve has some business to settle with
you. His account is three years old—maybe more—and
mine has only just begun. So you’re Steve’s
meat, Snake. Steve’s meat.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A MAN MEETS A MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> the Clove road plodded a man with a battered
face and a torn shirt, toting a pack and a gun. The
face was not so much disfigured as it had been awhile
ago, for it had just been laved in the cold, clear water
of Coxing Kill; but it still bore obvious marks of
conflict, chief of which was a pair of puffy eyes ringed
by darkening discolorations. The rent shirt gaped at
every stride, disregarded by its wearer, who swung
along as if careless of the opinions of others. Judging
from his gait, he knew where he was going and
purposed to reach his destination before early sundown
should cut off the light from his ridge-flanked
road.</p>

<p>Behind him, perhaps a quarter-mile back, another
man was riding in the same direction on the same
road. A big-framed, eagle-nosed, long-jawed old man
he was, with white mustache drooping around his
mouth and ragged wisps of snowy hair sticking out
from under his nondescript felt hat. His shoulders,
though humped up as he lounged forward on the reins
lying loosely along the back of a white horse, were
wide and bulky; and the gnarled hands holding those
reins were corded with sinew. Seventy if a day, he
still looked powerful enough to handle many a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of half his years; and the direct gaze of his steely blue
eyes betokened fearlessness of heart, simplicity of
nature, and honesty of soul.</p>

<p>Neither of the two men saw the other. Between
them intervened windings of the tree-lined road; the
tramping man cast no glance behind, and the one following
was not looking for him. Each in his own little
cloud of dust, the pair ambled on and drew steadily
nearer to a dingy house, behind which a man and a
woman were harvesting corn.</p>

<p>At the swinging approach of the pack-bearer the
couple halted their toil and squinted at him. He
waved a jaunty hand. Neither of the harvesters answered
the friendly gesture. In slouching attitudes
they stood, wooden-faced, watching him pass. With
a careless smile he looked them over, then turned his
gaze forward and ignored them.</p>

<p>Had he been let alone, he would have passed without
a word and speedily forgotten them. But, though the
couple made no threatening move, they had animals
which did. With a sudden bound three dogs appeared
from nowhere and silently rushed at him.</p>

<p>They were treacherous-looking mongrel beasts, and
their teeth gleamed wickedly as they came. The man
halted—took one comprehensive look—stepped back
and lifted his gun.</p>

<p>“Call ’em off!” he barked. “Call ’em or bury
’em!”</p>

<p>A shrill shriek of command burst from the woman.
A sour snarl broke from the man. At the sound of
the shrewish voice and the menace of the gun the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
dogs slowed abruptly. But they growled, and they did
not turn back.</p>

<p>“Call ’em off, I said!” commanded the man behind
the gun. “When I say off I mean off! Drive them
back and tie them up!”</p>

<p>Instead, the man advanced, muttering. His brown
face, of distinctly negro cast, was ugly; and he still
gripped his corn-knife—an abbreviated scythe, short-handled,
which would be a fearful weapon at close
quarters. The dogs, emboldened by his approach, began
slipping forward again.</p>

<p>“You can keep back too,” the stranger warned.
“This gun is likely to scatter right at you. Take those
beasts away quick if you want them to live. I won’t
say it again.”</p>

<p>“Shoot them dawgs an’ ye won’t git fur from here,”
the other snarled throatily. But he paused, and at the
cessation of his steps the brutes also stopped. The
woman still stood in the corn.</p>

<p>Just then the white horse and its white-haired driver
came jogging around a bushy turn. The old man sat
up with sudden energy, involuntarily jerking at the
reins. The horse stopped.</p>

<p>One swift survey the old man took. Then his right
hand shot to the whip-socket, and with awkward speed
he clambered out into the road.</p>

<p>“Nat!” he yelled explosively. “Git them dawgs
in or I’ll give the hull pack o’ ye a-hidin’! Shoot ’em
if ye want, stranger—they ain’t none of ’em no good!”</p>

<p>Douglas, his finger already tightening on one trigger,
held his fire and flicked a glance sidewise to see what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
sort of man was coming. He found the old fellow
running nimbly toward him, reversing his whip so that
its heavy butt was foremost. At that instant the man
Nat, his eyes glinting viciously, hissed at the dogs.</p>

<p>“Look ou-u-ut!” yelled the oncoming driver.</p>

<p>In the nick of time Douglas turned his eyes back—just
as a dog left the ground in a fang-grinning leap.
The other two were crouching. The blond man jerked
his gun a little downward to meet the rising body.
The dog’s breast struck against the muzzles. Teeth
clashed in a fierce snap. From the gun burst a muffled
roar. The dog was blown backward.</p>

<p>Under the impact of dog and powder-recoil Douglas
staggered. But he gave no ground and lost no time.
His second finger released the other hidden hammer at
an upshooting shape. In a crashing flare another
hairy form whirled over and flopped to earth.</p>

<p>At the same instant teeth stung his left side. A
sudden weight on his shirt yanked him almost off
balance. Under his arm he found the wicked face of
the third hound. Then a black streak appeared on that
dog’s head, a resounding thwack hit Douglas’ ears,
and the beast dangled limp, held up only by its teeth,
which were caught in the cloth.</p>

<p>“I told ye, Nat—I told ye!” panted the old man,
whose whip-butt had knocked out that third dog. “I
been tellin’ ye right ’long—— Git back, ye yeller
hound!”</p>

<p>Mouthing an inarticulate oath, the owner of the dogs
himself was now jumping forward, face convulsed and
corn-hook lifted. Whether he was attacking Douglas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
or his aged rescuer neither stopped to ascertain. Both
acted. The empty shotgun jabbed for the assailant’s
face, the barrels crunching solidly against his forehead.
The whip-butt swung down with the force of a
blackjack on his crown. His eyes rolled, his legs
caved, and he fell.</p>

<p>The young man and the old one swept their surroundings.
Two dogs were fairly blown apart. The
third still hung limp from Douglas’ shirt. The man
lay in a queer huddle, his corn-hook sticking in the
ground beside him, where it had fallen on its point.
The woman, shrieking with rage, now was running
at them with a similar blade.</p>

<p>“I told ye, Nat,” the old man said harshly, as if the
fallen man could hear him, “if ye didn’t learn them
dogs manners or tie ’em up somebody’d fix ’em. I
told ye I’d do it myself the next time they come for
me. Ye can say g’by to this here one too.”</p>

<p>Wherewith he clutched the dangling hound by the
scruff of the neck and, in one wrench, tore it away
from Douglas’ shirt. He flung it down, hopped up,
and landed with all his weight on the brute’s neck.
Under his heavy brogans sounded a crack of bones.</p>

<p>“’Lizy, ye better hold yer hosses,” he coolly cautioned
the woman, now close at hand. “I don’t want
to handle ye rough, but sure’s God made little apples
I’ll crack ye one ’less’n ye drop that ’ere cawn-hook.
I’m a-warnin’ ye.”</p>

<p>The thin-faced female, whose coarse hair and high
cheek-bones hinted strongly at Indian blood, screamed
out again. She burst into a torrent of vituperation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
that brought a red wave across the face of the younger
man and a corresponding flush into the leathery cheeks
of his fighting-mate. But she made no attack with the
ugly blade in her hand. Standing over the huddled
Nat, her bony bare toes digging at the turf like the
claws of a cat, she vented her fury in language which
would have brought swift physical retaliation if she
had been a man. And the pair stood silent and took it.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll pay for them pups, Eb Wilham—ye’ll pay
dear!” she foamed at the last. “Nat’ll take it outen
ye! Him an’ Snake’ll fix ye—an’ ye too, ye sneakin’
’tective! Ye mizzable pair o’ sneakers, ye better live
together an’ sleep together an’ watch out fer each
other now!”</p>

<p>She bent and squinted at her mate. The two men
looked suddenly at each other. The hillman stared as
if seeing the other for the first time. The newcomer
stared straight back, taking his first comprehensive
view of the two-handed old fellow and realizing what
the woman’s threat signified. For a minute old blue
eye and young blue eye held straight and steady. Then
on each mouth quirked a smile.</p>

<p>“If you’ve run out of words, I’ll say a few myself,”
clipped Douglas, turning to the woman. “If
there’s any more trouble coming from this it comes to
me, not to him. I never saw him before, and he
doesn’t know me. So you can tell your nigger man to
take it out on me. As for Snake, I knocked him cold
awhile ago and I can do it again. I’ll be around here
for some time, and anybody wanting the same dose
Snake got can come and get it. That’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>He nodded to the old man and turned away. He
took three steps before Eb Wilham stopped him.</p>

<p>“Hol’ on!” the latter exploded in the abrupt way
that seemed habitual. “I’m a-travelin’ your way. If
ye want a ride, set in. ’Lizy, git some sense. This
feller’s right—I dunno him. But I’m a-goin’ to know
him if he’s willin’. An’ as fur’s Nat an’ Snake’s
concerned, I been takin’ care o’ myself seventy-three
year an’ I figger to keep on doin’ it. What say,
stranger? Walk or ride?”</p>

<p>“Ride, if it doesn’t get you into trouble,” Douglas
acquiesced.</p>

<p>“No trouble. Snakes an’ yeller dawgs has bit at me
before an’ I ain’t dead. Chk! Hoss, g’yapalong!
G’yap, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>The white horse, sedately cropping grass, took a
few last bites, and came obediently. His master
climbed spryly into the weather-beaten wagon and
rolled an equally weather-beaten thumb at the rear.
Douglas heaved his pack in behind and swung himself
to the seat beside the driver.</p>

<p>The sharp-faced female screamed out with a fresh
burst of abuse. Old Eb’s mouth tightened, and he
lightly touched the horse with his whip. The animal
jumped in an astonished way and began slowly, heavily
pounding along the road. Woman, man, dogs and
house disappeared behind in a drifting cloud of
dust.</p>

<p>“Ain’t no use listenin’ or talkin’ to a mad woman,”
Eb barked conversationally. “Ain’t no use into it at
all. Uh—right fine weather we’re a-havin’, stranger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Right fine,” agreed Douglas. “Aren’t you worried
about riding with a detective, Mr. Wilham?”</p>

<p>The keen eyes shot at him and returned to the horse.</p>

<p>“Not a mite. I ride with who I want to. Folks
that’s scairt o’ detectives mostly has some reason to be.
I ain’t got no reason.”</p>

<p>“Found—one honest man in the Traps,” laughed
Douglas.</p>

<p>“That ain’t nothin’,” Eb retorted. “Folks is mostly
honest round here. Good hard-workin’ fellers. Don’t
jedge the rest of us by them Oakses. Or Snake Sanders.
Did ye say ye licked Snake?”</p>

<p>Getting no answer at once, he took another survey
of his passenger. Douglas was staring at the road.
So the hard pair behind were “them Oakses”—the
parents of the catamount girl!</p>

<p>“Er—oh, yes. Laid him out on top of that ledge
back yonder. Ought to have thrown him off. But I
didn’t.”</p>

<p>The horse thumped out a dozen steps while Eb digested
this.</p>

<p>“Ye’re right, stranger. Snake’s a bad ’un. Ye
must o’ had a hard tussle—Snake ain’t easy to handle.”
The shrewd eyes took in the battered face. “Up
top o’ Dickabar, hey? Hum!”</p>

<p>He became abstracted. The horse jogged on, steadily
eating up distance. The silence grew strained.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wilham, I’m no detective,” Douglas asserted.
“I’m just a rambler who blundered in here. My
name’s Douglas Hampton. I’m not after anybody, and
I’m staying awhile just because I like this country. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
don’t know who started this fool story that I’m a detective,
and I don’t care much. But now I’m here, I’ll
stay until I’m ready to go—unless I get starved out;
I haven’t much left to eat. That’s all there is to it.
Believe it or not. It’s true.”</p>

<p>The heavy hoofs beat another measure.</p>

<p>“I believe ye,” aggressively. “I know how ye feel.
I’m full o’ that same kind o’ cussedness myself.
There’s some folks round here that’s ignorant and
scairt of any new feller, and there’s some that’s got
reasons besides bein’ ignorant. I ain’t sayin’ who they
be; I ain’t talkin’ ’bout my neighbors even if I don’t
like some of ’em. But seein’ it’s gone round that ye’re
a detective, ’most everybody’ll believe it, an’ ye better
act accordin’—kind o’ go careful, I mean. Where ye
stayin’? Anywheres special?”</p>

<p>“Up in the rocks last night. Thought I might find
a house I could live in down here. Know of any?”</p>

<p>“Hum. Wal, we’re a-comin’ to a house, but I don’t
think ye’d want it. It’s—uh—kind o’ lonesome. Folks
says there’s some funny things into it. There ’tis
now.”</p>

<p>They emerged from a tunnel of trees, and Douglas
looked at a house which he knew must be that of Jake
Dalton. It was at the left of the road, in a clearing
rank with uncut grass, behind which rose forest headed
by two giant pines. It was a little box of a place, not
more than twenty feet square; weather-worn, with
patched roof and tiny sagging porch. The small bare
windows gaped black and blank at the forest cordon.
The door stood ajar, as if the latest occupant had left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in haste. About it hung an air of abandonment, of
desolation, of forbidding loneliness.</p>

<p>“Looks all right to me,” declared Douglas. “Not
very cheerful, but I’ll try it one night, anyway.
Whoa!”</p>

<p>Eb drew the reins. The horse stopped. Douglas
got out and lifted his pack. The old man sat soberly
staring at the house.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” he muttered. “I dunno. Stranger, ye
better ride on a piece.”</p>

<p>“Where to?”</p>

<p>“Um—I dunno. Mebbe somebody’d sleep ye. I’d
do it myself, but I’m a-goin’ to High Falls an’ I ain’t
comin’ back to-night.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I appreciate it just the same. But I
reckon I’ll stop here for the night. Much obliged to
you, Mr. Wilham, for the ride, and more for helping
me against those dogs.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t nothin’,” was the hasty disclaimer. “Them
dawgs ought to been kilt long ago—I give Nat warnin’
more’n once. An’ don’t call me Mister. I ain’t used
to it. ’Most everybody calls me Uncle Eb.”</p>

<p>“All right, Uncle Eb,” smiled the other.</p>

<p>The bright old eyes dwelt on him, and an answering
smile lifted the white mustache.</p>

<p>“Gorry, ye look funny with them eyes all bunged
up,” chuckled Eb. “Snake’s got a hard fist, ain’t he?
I wisht I could been a peewee bird up into a tree an’
seen that fight. It must of been good. Wal, son, if
ye can lick Snake mebbe ye can handle whatever ye
see round this house. I’ll stop here an’ visit with ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to-morrer, mebbe, when I come back. Shall I fetch
ye some food from High Falls?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. Lots of it. And some tobacco.”</p>

<p>“Smokin’ or chawin’?”</p>

<p>“Smoking. And for food get whatever comes
handy. I’m not fussy.”</p>

<p>He drew out a small wallet. Uncle Eb waved it
aside.</p>

<p>“Pay me when ye git yer stuff, boy. I dunno yit
what it’ll cost. I’ll git jest what I’d buy for myself.
Then if—if ye ain’t here to-morrer I can use it to
home. G’by. G’yapalong!”</p>

<p>The hoofs hammered again into the sand. In a
fresh cloud of dust the rickety wagon rolled away and
was gone among the trees beyond.</p>

<p>Douglas shoved his wallet back into its pocket and
stood a minute eyeing the little house glooming under
the solemn pines. Then, reaching to his pack, he
pulled from under its straps his coat. From that garment
he drew two buckshot shells. Coolly he reloaded
his gun.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll be here to-morrow when you come
back, Uncle Eb,” he muttered. “Now, Mister Ha’nt,
let’s get acquainted.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE HA’NT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunset</span> stretched its long shadows again across the
Traps.</p>

<p>Up on the heights, the light of day still was bright
and clear. But down in the bluff-bulwarked valley
of the Coxing Kill, a thousand feet lower than the
Minnewaska table-land behind which the sun was rolling
down in the southwest, the dusk was slowly shading
into dark. Already the air vibrated with the
swelling chorus of the katydids, scraping out their insistent
warning of frost which had not yet come; and
from every grassy space cheeped the lonesome dirge
of the crickets. Night was drawing on.</p>

<p>Down on the diminutive stoop of a little house beside
the Clove road, a man stirred and glanced around
him with a frown. The steadily increasing clack of
the big green bush-bugs and the growing chill of eventide
had routed the thoughts which he had been drawing
through the stem of a blackened but empty pipe—thoughts
which, to judge from his absent gaze and the
half-smile on his lips, were more pleasant than those
now obtruding themselves. He shook his shoulders as
if to dislodge the night chill settling there. Abruptly
he stood up.</p>

<p>His swift survey swept the little fallow field at his
right, where the black choristers of the grass were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
chirping away among the unseen roots; the narrow
sand-track of road, empty of all but thickening
shadows; the darkling mass of trees and brush at his
left. Then he pivoted and peered into the darkness
lying beyond a door which had been standing open at
his back.</p>

<p>Nothing showed in the room beyond—nothing, that
is, which should hold the fixed attention of a man;
nothing alive. Vaguely, in the wan light still entering
through the cracked panes of a curtainless side
window, he could see a rickety table with one leg
broken, a chair minus a back, a little rusty stove, and,
in one corner, a jumble of small things recently
dumped from his pack. Along a wall which started
beside the open doorway showed the faint outlines of
three more doors, all in a row. And that was all.</p>

<p>Nothing, surely, in such a scene need make this man
listen keenly and half lift the shotgun in one fist. Yet
he stood there for a long minute, searching the room
repeatedly, then centering his gaze on the first of those
three doors in the wall. That door stood open. And
the queer chill between his shoulder-blades was not all
due to the coolness following the sinking of the sun:
it was that clammy feeling inherited by mankind
through countless generations—the subconscious warning
that a hidden menace lurks behind the back. And
his ears subtly corroborated the caution of his nerves.
Despite the clamor of the insects, he could have sworn
that in the first room there at the right he had heard
a slight rustle.</p>

<p>That room was the bedroom. It was a mere cubby-hole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
not more than seven feet square, containing only
a crude bed and a lamp-shelf, both fixed. The bedstead,
which the new tenant had inspected and decided
to use, apparently had been built in the room by the
former owner; a solid contrivance of boards and hardwood
posts, with interlaced ropes serving as a spring,
and a noisy mattress of corn-husks. Head, foot, and
one side were snug against three of the walls, leaving
only a yard-wide space between bed and door. At the
foot was the one tiny window of the room.</p>

<p>To enter that sleeping-closet, anything must go
through the door or the window. The window now
stood open, for Douglas had forced up its cobwebby
frame after sweeping the floor as best he could with
a stubby old broom found in the grass; but that opening
was within ten feet of his left hand as he sat on
the steps, and nothing could possibly have gone in
there without his knowledge. Still less could anything
have gone past him through the door. Yet he felt in
his marrow that something was there.</p>

<p>With slow, careful shifting of his balance he stole
across the meagre stoop. Not a board creaked, not a
sound did his descending soles make. With the same
stealth he leaned against the door-jamb and inched his
head inside. At length, braced by hands against the
wall, he was leaning far in and peering through that
right-hand door. In the dimness beyond stood no living
thing.</p>

<p>Until his arm-muscles began to ache he hung there;
and never a sound came to him from within. Yet his
nerves continued to deliver their warning. In that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
room where Jake Dalton had slept was <i>something</i>;
something besides the bed and the bare lamp-shelf;
invisible, intangible, but—<i>something</i>!</p>

<p>He drew back and glanced around once more. The
dusk was drawing around the little clearing a closer
cordon of gloom; an eerie whisper came from the
pines, swept by a gusty wind; the throb of insects resounded
as before. Nothing moved. He felt for a
match. When he had it, he stepped heavily into the
house and tramped over to his gas-lamp, hanging on a
nail; turned its valve, shook it up, and waited for the
water and carbide to mingle and form the gas. In the
brief interval of waiting he watched all around and
rapidly reviewed his movements since opening that
window.</p>

<p>He had explored the place, finding at the second
door a stairway leading into a dusty loft littered with
dead wasps; at the third, a room even smaller than the
bedroom, partly filled with stove-wood. Outside he
had found a well, in which the water seemed good, and
a little shed holding only a broken barrel or two, burlap
bags, an empty jug, and similar trash. Both door
and window had been open while he made his inspection;
but he had returned to the bedroom and tossed
his blankets on the mattress, and nothing new was
there then. And since that time he had not been more
than ten feet from it.</p>

<p>The fumes of gas struck his nostrils. He lit the
match and touched it to the little nozzle. White and
bright, the flame lit up the place. He strode into the
bedroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Absolutely nothing new was there. With a self-derisive
grin, he stooped and glanced under the bed.
The floor was bare.</p>

<p>“Now are you satisfied, you timid old woman?” he
jeered. “What’s the matter with you, anyhow? Getting
nerves?”</p>

<p>His words hollowly mocked him from the outer
room. With a disgusted snort he turned away. Boots
thumping defiantly, he clattered back to the three-legged
table, shoved its crippled side against the wall,
kicked the backless chair up to it, and set the lamp on
it. To the little pile in the corner he went, and from
it he extracted the dry remainder of a bread-loaf and
a paper-wrapped chunk of cheese. Then he returned
and sat down, hitching around in the chair to get his
back toward a windowless wall.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he meditated, sawing off a slice of
bread with his jack-knife, “if I stay here long I’ll have
to make some improvements. For one thing, that bedroom
is too darned handy. Window opens right on
the road. So does the front door. No curtains on
any of these windows, no key for that door. With
Snake Sanders and Nat Oaks both thirsting for my
gore and undoubtedly acquainted with the position of
that bed—yes, I reckon I’d better move up-stairs or
something. No use in lying meekly down and inviting
a fistful of shot to come in and mess me up. No sense
in sitting here in the light now, either.”</p>

<p>He turned off the gas-flow, set the lamp under the
table, and fell to munching his meagre provender.</p>

<p>“However, I’m safe enough in that room to-night,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
he told himself. “Nobody knows I’m here except
Uncle Eb, who isn’t coming back until to-morrow—and
maybe little Miss Marion, who isn’t likely to tell.
There’s nothing in that room but imagination, and
imagination won’t keep me very wide awake. Ho-hum!
I’m going to sleep like a log this night.”</p>

<p>He arose, dipped a cup of well-water from his
canvas pail dangling from a nail in a low ceiling-beam,
washed down his food, and reseated himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he informed the loneliness, carving another
chunk of cheese, “this is my night to sleep.
Last night I sprawled between two rocks, and the night
before I lost a lot of repose watching those backwoods
detectives prowl around and spy on me from the
bushes down beside the creek. Things have been coming
right fast in the last three days. Before that I’d
never been inside that wall of cliffs over yonder. And
now I’ve killed a catamount, assisted at the demise of
three dogs, knocked one eminent citizen stiff and
helped send another to sleep; made two able-bodied
enemies and one potential friend—Uncle Eb—and
given love’s young dream a boost along the rocks to
a new hide-out. Oh, yes, and assisted an escaped
conv——”</p>

<p>He bit off the last word, suddenly aware that he was
talking aloud and recalling the ancient proverb to the
effect that walls sometimes listen. Gloom now surrounded
him, for the slow-dying gas flame had sunk
to a little blue button on its nozzle. Rising again, he
tiptoed to the door and spied around. No lurking
form was near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Guess that will be about enough talking,” he concluded.</p>

<p>He drew back and shut the door. Stepping across
the room, he found the table, brought it over, and set
it against the door so that the slightest push from outside
would tip it over with a warning clatter. Then he
went along the walls, tested the windows and a rear
door—all of which were warped into immovability—and,
carrying his gun and the chair, retired to the
gloomy bedroom. There he placed gun and chair beside
the bed, and on the chair he laid matches. After
frowning thoughtfully at the open window he sighed
and closed it.</p>

<p>Deliberately he undressed and rolled up in his blankets.
For a minute or two he lay reveling in his freedom
from clothing and the yielding embrace of the
crackling but comfortable old mattress. Then the first
grateful feeling of physical comfort passed. He lifted
his head from the rolled-up coat forming his pillow,
and turned his dilating eyes around. Over him was
creeping a feeling of oppression, of inability to obtain
air; and, worse yet, a panicky sensation that he was in
a trap.</p>

<p>The blankets were snug and warm; yet that queer
chill was crawling over him again. The air was fresh
and clean; yet he opened his mouth as if stifled.
Around him lay silence and blackness, intensified
rather than relieved by the deadened chorus of insects
outside and the lighter shade of the window. He
turned suddenly on a side. At the loud rustle of the
husks under him he jumped half erect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>A moment he poised; then he flung himself angrily
back.</p>

<p>“You idiot!” he muttered. “You miss the stars
overhead and the little night breezes around; that’s
all. You’re in a house, and you’ll have to get used to
it. Go to sleep, you fool!”</p>

<p>He shut his eyes and forced himself to breathe
regularly. But through his brain streaked the
thought:</p>

<p>“<i>You’re in a dead man’s bed! You don’t know
what killed him! You——</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” he growled aloud, bouncing over
on the other side. “What’s that to me? I’m going
to sleep!”</p>

<p>For a few minutes he stubbornly held his position.
But he was lying now with his back to the open door
into the main room, and the creepy feeling at his
shoulder-blades became intolerable. He turned again.
But this time he made the movement deliberately, and
at the repeated crackle of the mattress he grinned.
After blinking at the dark a minute he relaxed, warm
once more at the back, his eyes closing naturally.</p>

<p>Rapidly his fatigue asserted itself. With the muffled
lullaby of the crickets swinging rhythmically on, he
lost himself.</p>

<p>Hours passed. He slept peacefully on, changing his
position a little at intervals, unconscious of his movements
or of anything else. Then, all at once, he found
himself up on an elbow, staring wide-eyed into the
dark.</p>

<p>Something had moved. It seemed that the bed itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
was quivering slightly. Yet there was no sound
near him—no new sound anywhere——</p>

<p>What was that? There was a sound now—but not
in the room. It was up overhead—up in the empty
attic; a sound of muffled footfalls, deliberately crossing
the floor; a sound like that of bare heels going
quietly across the boards. It traveled to and fro, as if
an undressed man were wandering aimlessly. Then
it began to come down-stairs.</p>

<p>A bump, and it stopped. Another bump; another
pause. Then two soft bumps telling of a couple more
stairs descended. It was the sound of a man stealing
quietly down, halting to listen for any noise below; a
man not deft enough to put his weight on his toes
and avoid the bump of heels. Yet the stairs did not
creak as they would under the weight of a man.</p>

<p>Very quietly, Douglas moved over and found a
match. With the same stealth he opened the gas-valve
of his lamp. While he waited for the acetylene
flow he heard the heels reach the lowest step. He
listened for the stealthy turning of the knob and the
creak of door-hinges. They did not come.</p>

<p>Cracking the match on his thumb-nail, he lit the gas
and shot its ray outward. Nothing met his gaze—nothing
but the table against the outer door. Softly
he lowered his feet, gripped his gun, and arose. Reason
told him no man could be in that attic; but his
ears positively asserted that a man had come down
those stairs.</p>

<p>On his toes he drifted outward. In the main room
he saw no living thing. Quietly he set the lamp on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the floor, its beam glaring at the stair door. With a
swift grab he turned the knob and tore the door open.</p>

<p>Then, gun leveled, he stood and gaped.</p>

<p>The stairway was utterly empty.</p>

<small>DALTON’S DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A long</span> minute dragged by while Douglas stood
there, the drone of the crickets gnawing at his nerves.
Then he pounced at the lamp and bounded up the
stairs. At the top he halted and glared around the
attic.</p>

<p>Nothing was there.</p>

<p>The tiny windows at either end, heavily coated with
spider-webs, were shut as usual. Not a web was
broken. Nowhere, except where one little pane had
long been missing, could he see any opening into the
barren room. He moved about, and the boards groaned
loudly under him. They had not groaned under that
ghostly unknown.</p>

<p>He returned down the stairs, and the steps creaked
and squeaked as he passed. He slammed the door
and went about the room, inspecting every door and
window. All was as he had left it on retiring. He
even glanced into the little wood-room. That, too,
was unchanged.</p>

<p>“H’m!” he muttered. Pausing at the water-bag,
he gulped a drink. After once more staring around,
he returned to the bedroom.</p>

<p>Back into his tumbled blankets he got. As the
strangled flame of his lamp slowly died he reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
to his trousers, dug out his watch, and glanced at it.
It was now eight minutes after midnight.</p>

<p>“H’m!” he repeated as he lay back.</p>

<p>For some time after the light had expired he lay
wide-eyed. No further sound came from stairs or
attic. In the solid blackness he discerned nothing.
At length he grinned.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ve laid you for the night, Mister Ha’nt,”
he whispered.</p>

<p>As if in answer, the bed quivered again. The feeling
was as if some man standing beside him had rested
a hand on the headboard—a barely perceptible tremor.
He had not moved a muscle. Nor, suddenly frozen,
did he move one now. He lay absolutely still, only his
eyes moving.</p>

<p>Another quiver came. With it came a faint dry
rustle. Nerves and straining ears alike flashed the
same message: it was the corn-husk mattress now!
The movement, the sound, were beside him, almost
under him—as if a bodiless man were laying himself
down to rest side by side with the live one!</p>

<p>With lightning speed Douglas turned and struck at
the Thing. His knuckles crashed against the old cloth
and its content of husks. Again he struck, this time
into the air. With a dive he launched himself at the
chair—clutched matches—scratched them. The yellow
blaze showed that the room was empty of all life
but his own.</p>

<p>Scrambling out, he lit fresh matches and scanned
the floor under the bed. Then he wheeled and looked
all about the outer room. All was as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>The matches burned his fingers, and he dropped
them. Again blackness and vacancy engulfed him.
Groping, he found the bed and lay down. Then he
reached out, found his gun, and laid it beside him.
And this time he did not roll up in his blankets. He
only draped one of them loosely over him, and kept a
hand on the gun.</p>

<p>“Come again, Mister Ha’nt,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Only the monotonous chorus outside answered. For
a long time he lay waiting, his nerves gradually relaxing.
At length, still loosely holding the weapon, he
dozed away into slumber.</p>

<p>He awoke as if struck by a blow. A heavy thump
had shocked him awake. Instantly he knew what
caused it. The table against the outer door had been
pushed over. The damp night air was sweeping in.</p>

<p>His gun leaped up. Its muzzles licked toward the
entrance. One barrel vomited flame and lead.</p>

<p>The flare of the explosion lit up the portal. It
stood ajar, but not wide enough to admit a man. Nor
was any man standing there. Outside was only black,
cavernous night.</p>

<p>His ears numbed by the concussion of the shell, he
squatted there in the blankets, the other barrel ready
for instantaneous use. Presently his stunned auditory
nerves regained their acuteness. They told him something
that brought a new chill crawling down his back.
The song of the insects no longer swung through the
night. And out there on the steps sounded a dull,
slow <i>drip</i>—<i>drip</i>—<i>drip</i>.</p>

<p>With measured beat that dread sound hammered at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
his brain. It slowed, as if the first flow of falling
fluid were becoming choked—or clotted. Then it
ceased.</p>

<p>Shuddering, he moved once more to the edge, groped
about until he found his boots, and slipped his legs into
them. Feeling again through the dark, he located his
matches. But he did not light one. With half a dozen
of the little light-sticks in his hand, he stepped stealthily
to the front door.</p>

<p>Long he listened, hearing nothing but a weird
whisper of night wind among leaves. The air was
clammy, and in it was a wet smell. He began to shiver
again; but this time the cold was natural—the dank
cold of dampness. Feeling about, he found a leg of
the overturned table. On it he scratched a match, and
out into the uncanny gloom beyond the door he darted
the burning sliver.</p>

<p>The stoop was empty. The thing he had dreaded to
find slumped against the wall was not there. Nor were
the old boards disfigured by any fresh red stain.</p>

<p>Sorely perplexed, he ignited a new match from the
expiring stub. As he did so a new thought struck his
mind. Perhaps the dead thing was in the room, huddled
beside him. He yanked the match inward—and
found nothing but the capsized table, its legs wedging
the door.</p>

<p>As the light died down a sudden soft sound made
him jump. It was a single drop falling on the steps
outside.</p>

<p>With a new match flaring he yanked the door open
and strode out, angrily determined to find the source<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
of those soul-sickening drops. He had not far to go.
After one straight look at the steps he flung down the
match and laughed out in savage scorn of himself.</p>

<p>The narrow steps were wet, but with nothing more
sinister than rain. The dampness of the air, the utter
blackness around, the silence of the insects—all told
of a recent shower. Even now the crickets were beginning
to chirp again. Somehow their sturdy notes,
which previously had seemed doleful, now sounded
cheerful.</p>

<p>“You doddering imbecile!” he jeered. “It’s as
simple as daylight. A little shower just before you
woke up—a gust of wind shoving the door open—the
drip of the eaves for a minute or so. And you, you
hysterical half-wit—you shoot a harmless door and
turn into a knot of goose-flesh because of that! Who
ever told you you were a grown-up man? You’re
nothing but a scared-of-the-dark baby!”</p>

<p>He drank in a deep breath of the sweet air and
nodded unseen encouragement to some lusty cricket in
the grass near the stoop. But, as he turned again toward
the door, he hesitated. Wind and rain could not
be blamed for the footsteps on the stairs or the sounds
and movements of his bed. Something urged him to
take his blankets and lie down outdoors, even though
the ground was wet: to sleep surrounded by the honest-voiced
crickets, unconfined by walls within which
stalked bodiless things.</p>

<p>“No!” he growled. “Back to bed you go, and
there you stay. This is a fight to a finish, Mister
Ha’nt, and I’ve taken one round out of three, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the other two drawn. I think I’ve got you on the run.
Now let’s see if you can come back.”</p>

<p>With that he felt his way in, shut the door, kicked
the table negligently against it, and returned to bed.</p>

<p>As he rearranged his blankets, heavy drops thudded
overhead. Rapidly the spattering impacts swelled into
a drumming roar of new rain.</p>

<p>“Aha,” he nodded. “You’d look sweet out in the
grass now, wouldn’t you? By the time you got back
in here you’d be well soaked, and it would serve you
right. The Lord hates a quitter. Come on, Ha’nt.
I’m waiting.”</p>

<p>He continued to wait. Steadily the rain pounded
on, varied only by slashing swoops at the window.
His eyes closed. His breathing slowed. The tumult
of the storm faded out of his consciousness.</p>

<p>By and by he found himself drifting over a murky
waste of waters which swashed and hissed and gurgled
in sullen enmity. Above was no sun or moon or star—nothing
but a dreary void. Around was no life; he
was utterly alone in the desolation of plunging waves, a
derelict at the mercy of wind and tide. But presently
weird shapes took form among the billows—ghastly,
gigantic wraiths which mouthed hideous grimaces
down at him and reached for him with shadowy fingers.
They veered away before they touched him, and
a great wind blew them apart into fragments of mist
and spume. But they formed again, making more
frightful spectres than before, and stalked athwart the
waste, half seen through a roaring deluge of rain.
They began to yell his name, and with the shouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
blended a thunder of hollow blows. He tried to yell
back at them——</p>

<p>He was in his bed again. Wan daylight was in his
opening eyes. The noise of falling rain was real. So
were the loud knocking and the calling of his name.
The pounding came from the outer door, and the voice
was that of Uncle Eb.</p>

<p>“Hey, Hampton! Hampton! Speak up if ye’re
livin’!”</p>

<p>He jumped from bed, shoved the table away from
the entrance, and pulled the door open. Uncle Eb, his
mustache drooping in a bedraggled wisp and his body
gleaming dully in a wet rubber coat, took a sudden
backward step.</p>

<p>“Gorry, boy! Ye scairt me, a-snakin’ the door open
so sudden. I was about gittin’ ready to go ’long.
How be ye?”</p>

<p>“All right, thanks. Come in. Wet morning.”</p>

<p>“Mornin’? It’s ’most noon, son. Ye been sleepin’
all this time? Mebbe—mebbe ye was broke of yer
rest, though. That it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. You were right—there are some funny
things around this place.”</p>

<p>The old man nodded quickly, and his eyes swerved
to the door. Following his gaze, Douglas saw that the
panels were furrowed across by shot, and in the casing
beyond was a splintery hole.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a mite s’prised,” was the guarded admission.
“But git yer pants on an’ don’t stand here with yer
shirt-tail a-flappin’. I got some tobacker an’ so on
into the wagon—whoa, Bob! a little more rain won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
hurt ye after what ye come through—I’ll git it right
out. Snake on yer clo’es before ye git cold.”</p>

<p>Yawning, Douglas snaked them on. By the time he
emerged from his bedroom Uncle Eb had returned
with a bulky box which seemed almost dry. Without
ceremony he tramped in and dropped the box with a
thud.</p>

<p>“Thar she is, right side up with care an’ dry as
Nigger Nat—been ridin’ under a rubber blankit all the
way. Gorry, ain’t this a rain! It’s the line storm.
What say? Oh, four dollars an’ thutty-five cents.
Thank ye.”</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me. Peel off your coat and light your
pipe while I get breakfast—or luncheon, or whatever
you want to call it. Why do you say ‘dry as Nigger
Nat’?”</p>

<p>“Wal——” Uncle Eb hesitated, looking toward
the stove. “No, I can’t stop. I got to git ’long, or
the folks’ll think somebody waylaid me—I’d oughter
be to home now. Nat? Oh, that’s jest a sayin’ we’ve
got round here—‘dry as Nigger Nat.’ He’s one o’
them misfortunit critters that can’t never drownd his
thirst, if ye know what I mean. He warn’t round to
visit with ye last night, was he?” He turned toward
the shot-scored door.</p>

<p>“Not to my knowledge. Sit down a minute, and
I’ll tell you about my visitors. Yes, I had some.”</p>

<p>Duty and curiosity struggled a few seconds in Uncle
Eb. Curiosity, of course, won. He accepted the chair
and some new tobacco, loaded a disreputable old pipe,
puffed as Douglas held a blazing match for him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
looked expectant. Douglas, his own pipe aglow,
forthwith enlightened him as to the happenings of the
night. He made merry over his various scares; but
the older man, his eyes soberly traveling from door to
door, did not echo his mirth.</p>

<p>“By mighty, boy, I take off my hat to ye,” he
barked. “I ain’t scairt o’ nothin’ that walks or crawls
or swims or flies, an’ I ain’t soop’stitious nuther, but
I don’t want to live into no house where things walks
without no feet an’ jiggles a bed without no hands.
No sirree! I guess mebbe ’twas the wind that blowed
yer door open—must of been. But them other
things——”</p>

<p>He shook his head and spat noisily on the floor.</p>

<p>“I want to tell ye sumpthin’,” he went on. “I
thought I wouldn’t tell ye yesterday, so’s ye wouldn’t
git scairt beforehand; but after I went ’long I wished
I had, so’s ye’d be ready. I been worried ever sence.
Thinks I, if anything comes to ye into the night an’
catches ye asleep it’ll be my fault for not tellin’ ye.</p>

<p>“Wal, now, this house was Jake Dalton’s. He
warn’t a sociable critter, lived all by hisself, kind o’
growled if ye spoke to him; an’ he used to go ’way for
days to a time—had sumpthin’ to do up back, mebbe—I
never ast no questions. But I drive up an’ down
’tween here an’ High Falls pretty reg’lar—I git my
mail thar an’ so on—an’ I know how everything looks
’long the way. An’ Jake’s door was always shut,
whether he was to home or not—’less’n he jest happened
to be comin’ out when I went by.</p>

<p>“But one day I see this door a-standin’ a little ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
open an’ Jake nowheres round. I didn’t say nothin’—I
went ’long an’ come back, an’ ’twas jest the same.
I kind o’ figgered about it, but then I thought mebbe
Jake was drinkin’ up a new jug inside here an’ didn’t
know ’nough to shut his door—he used to git that way.
So I went ’long. But about three-four days later on
somebody said Jake’s door was open yit, an’—wal,
some of us come down here to see what was what.</p>

<p>“Jake was out back. He was the deadest man I
ever see. He’d been thar—I dunno how long, but too
long anyway. I ain’t a-goin’ to tell ye how he looked—I
don’t want to remember it too plain. But we couldn’t
see a mark onto him, an’ we dunno yit what kilt him.
But he got kilt sometime into the night.</p>

<p>“We know that much, ’cause Jake was undressed—nothin’
onto him but his shirt—an’ we found the rest
o’ his clo’es hangin’ on nails beside the bed, an’ his
shoes layin’ onto the floor jest where he dropped ’em.
He had got up an’ tore open this front door an’ run
out back an’ fell down an’ died. He was dyin’ when
he run out o’ here, too—he only went a little ways.
But what he was runnin’ away from—what had got
holt o’ him before he run—nobody knows. Nobody
but Jake, an’ he can’t tell.</p>

<p>“That’s all there is to it, ’cept this: two-three fellers
tried livin’ here an’ they couldn’t. They heard them
same things that was round ye last night, an’ other
things too, ’cordin’ to what I’ve heard tell; an’ they
<i>felt</i> sumpthin’ that was worse’n what they heard.
They jest couldn’t stand it. So they took everything
wuth carryin’ an’ got out, an’ sence then nobody’s been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
here but Dalton’s Death—that’s what folks calls the
thing that walks here nights: Dalton’s Death. I dunno
if—— Whoa thar, Bob, <i>whoa</i>! Back up!”</p>

<p>He clattered to the door and plunged out. Douglas
followed, to find him grabbing the reins and halting the
white horse.</p>

<p>“Got to go ’long, boy,” he shouted from the edge of
the road. “Bob’s a-gittin’ cranky, an’ mebbe he’s got
a right to. ’Tain’t fitten weather for hoss or man.
Come on up an’ visit with me any time.”</p>

<p>He clambered in and turned to yell an afterthought.</p>

<p>“Don’t leave yer gun here when ye go out. Ye
might lose it. Some folks ain’t scairt o’ Dalton’s Death
’ceptin’ at night. G’by. G’yapalong!”</p>

<p>Blurred by the rain, he rolled away and was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>A SCRAP OF PAPER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Singing</span> a sleepy little song, the waters of Coxing
Kill flowed lazily down their stony channel into a deep
green pool.</p>

<p>A week ago, swollen by the deluge of the equinox,
the Kill had ramped and roared through this glen,
overwhelming both the shallows and the depths in
brawling, swirling flood. But now the tumult and violence
were past, the raw chill had fled from the air,
and under the soft sun of new October the pool had
again become its serene self: rimmed by vertical gray-white
rock, shadowed by shaggy hemlocks, reflecting
on its placid bosom the snowy clouds floating across the
high blue above—an exquisite little gem of sylvan
beauty which would have held an artist enthralled. Yet
it knew few visitors except the birds and the squirrels,
whose practical eyes saw nothing of its charm; for it
was well away from the Clove road, and few of the
denizens of the Traps ever wasted their time seeking
scenery.</p>

<p>To-day, however, the little nook was not empty of
human life. At the upper end of the small chasm a
figure sat against the base of one of the hemlocks,
its bare feet tucked under the hem of a faded dress,
its tumbled hair glowing red in the sunlight filtering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
down through the eastern tree-tangle. The little birds
and the wood-mice, moving about in their unceasing
search for food, paused at times to cock their round
eyes at that unwonted gleam of red against the bark.
But soon they resumed their activities, unafraid; for,
though they could not understand what the girl sitting
so quietly there was doing, they felt that she was a
friend.</p>

<p>On her updrawn knees rested a slanting piece of thin
board, and on the board a scrap of paper. Her pensive
gray eyes studied the short vista down-stream, and
from time to time she moved a stubby pencil lightly
along the sheet, transferring to it new lines. Then,
with a frown, she would wet a finger-tip at her mouth
and rub out a line or two.</p>

<p>It seemed to be an absorbing task, this marking and
erasing and studying, upon which she was concentrating
her whole soul. Yet it was not so engrossing as to
rob her of the senses which she possessed in common
with the tiny wild things around her. All at once she
and a king-bird which had silently settled near by and
a mouse under a bush and a chipmunk on a bowlder-top
did exactly the same thing—froze in the intuitive
immobility of the wilderness, looking northward. A
few yards beyond, a stick had cracked dully under
foot.</p>

<p>Among the tree-trunks a moving form presently became
visible, advancing with no particular stealth but
with the quiet step of a man acquainted with woods
travel. The king-bird launched himself on soundless
wings and was gone. The mouse faded into a hole.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
The chipmunk whisked about on his tail and poised for
a lightning jump. The girl made no movement whatever.</p>

<p>The man swung nonchalantly along the brink of the
rock rim, plumbing with casual gaze the clear water
below. Then he halted, his lifting gaze caught and
held by the red glint under the hemlock. A smile
lit up his lightly bronzed face.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Miss Marion,” he bowed. “Are you
‘waylaying’ me?”</p>

<p>“If I was, you’d be all shot ’fore now,” she retorted.
“I could ’most stick a gun right into your
mouth from here. Are you near-sighted or somethin’?”</p>

<p>“Blind as a bat, I reckon. I can’t see a thing beyond
you, so I’m going to stop and visit until my sight
clears up.”</p>

<p>She flushed and sat up straighter.</p>

<p>“Are you makin’ fun of my hair?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, no. Certainly not. What made you think
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, everybody does. They say Nigger Nat don’t
need a lamp with my red-head there into the house, and
anybody that meets me onto the road says he thought
’twas a forest-fire comin’, and—oh, I’m sick of it! I
thought mebbe you wanted to be funny the same way
when you said you couldn’t see past me.”</p>

<p>“No, no. It was a poor joke, but I didn’t mean it
that way.” He dropped beside her, laying his gun
beside his right leg. “Don’t let folks bother you.
Chances are that they’d give anything to have hair like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
yours—the women, anyway—but because they can’t
have it they make fun of it. It’s the way of the world.
What’s this?”</p>

<p>His hand lifted the forgotten paper and board from
her lap. She snatched at it.</p>

<p>“Gimme that!”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” He jerked it aside and held it out of
reach. “Why, it’s a sketch! Let’s see—here’s the
creek, and——”</p>

<p>She threw herself at him, her cheeks burning, her
hands struggling to seize the paper.</p>

<p>“You gimme that!” she blazed. “’Tain’t no good—don’t
you look at it!”</p>

<p>But he laughed and stretched his long right arm to
its longest, holding the paper a yard from her.</p>

<p>“Now don’t get excited. I won’t hurt it. I like to
look at pictures——”</p>

<p>She tore at his left arm, which blocked her like a
steel bar.</p>

<p>“You—you—gimme that—paper!” she panted. “If
you don’t I’ll—I’ll scratch!”</p>

<p>He shot a shrewd glance at her furious face and at
the slender, long-nailed fingers now poising in curving
menace. The restraining arm gave way suddenly—so
suddenly that she pitched forward. In one flashing
instant that arm had looped around her and
pinned her against him, her own arms blocked by his
body.</p>

<p>“You little wildcat, I believe you would,” he
nodded. “But I really haven’t finished looking at the
picture. So behave yourself. Now let’s see—there’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
hemlock—good, too! And the rock edge along—no,
that’s not so good. But still, I can easily see what it’s
meant for, and—— Behave, I say!”</p>

<p>Writhing, wrenching, heaving, she was fighting like
a mad thing to break his hold and free her hands. His
arm only crushed her tighter. Tears of helpless anger
welled into her eyes. All at once her head dropped on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“There, don’t cry.” He loosened his hold. “I’ll
give it right—— Ouch!”</p>

<p>Instead of weeping on his shoulder she was biting it.
He dropped the board and lurched upward, drawing
her with him. She lifted her head and laughed out
wildly.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll let me go now, won’t you?” she
taunted.</p>

<p>His jaw set. His right arm, too, swept around her,
holding her loosely, yet close.</p>

<p>“Think so?” he challenged. “Go on and bite!
Bite hard!”</p>

<p>The blazing gray eyes burned up into the steely blue
ones. Breast to breast, body to body, they stood, their
eyes welded together. She made to move her head,
but the motion died. Still their eyes clung. And then
something happened.</p>

<p>How, why, what it was neither knew—perhaps a
subtle opening of some hitherto unknown chamber of
the heart. But the fire died from the gray eyes, the
chill melted from the blue ones; and something else
crept into their unswerving gaze. For unmeasured
minutes the man and the girl stood in silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Then his arms slowly loosened. Swaying a little,
she stepped away.</p>

<p>“I—you—nobody never hugged me like that before,”
she whispered, as if unconscious of her words.
“I’m—I’m dizzy, seems like.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“I ain’t,” she breathed. Wide-eyed, she stared up
as if seeing a man for the first time in her life: as if
some fairy wand had swept from before her a veil
through which she had regarded men as creatures little
more interesting than any other common animals.
“Why—why are <i>you</i> sorry?”</p>

<p>He made no answer. His gaze dropped and rested
absently on the pencil-lined paper which had brought
it all about.</p>

<p>“Why did you—let me go?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of—Steve,” was his slow reply.</p>

<p>Her face clouded. Her head drooped, and her
fingers intertwined.</p>

<p>“Steve,” she repeated. “I see. I—I was forgittin’
about Steve.”</p>

<p>She sank down and sat with her chin in her hands,
soberly contemplating the passing water. He bent,
picked up the paper, and forced his mind to concentrate
on it. After a studious interval he nodded and
looked thoughtfully at the tapering fingers which so
recently had threatened his face.</p>

<p>“Er—ahem! Do you know, Miss Marion, that you
have the rudiments of art? I’m no artist myself, but
I know a little about it. How did you ever come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
to draw like this? And why didn’t you want me to
see it?”</p>

<p>She looked up, but in a detached way. Then her
eyes returned to the creek.</p>

<p>“’Most everybody makes fun of my pictures,” she
said, as if only part of her mind were talking. “I
dunno what you mean by rood—roody—what you said
about art. But I like to draw; it comes natural. I
git spells when I jest <i>have</i> to draw things. That’s
what got me throwed out of school. I’d draw pictures
and teacher would catch me and tear ’em up—and one
day I ’most tore him up too: I flew and scratched his
face, and I got put out, and that was the end of my
schoolin’. I don’t care. I don’t want to go to school
and work onto figgers and have ’em make fun of me
’cause my hair’s red and my pop’s a nigger and all.
I’d ruther go off by my own self and make pictures
into the woods and rocks.</p>

<p>“There was an artist feller in here two-three years
back—they come round sometimes—and I watched
how he worked and tried to do like it, and when he
see what I was up to he laughed and laughed and—I
can’t stand to be laughed at! I thought you’d laugh
too, soon as you see what I made onto that paper.”</p>

<p>He said nothing for a time. He pondered on her
work, studied her again, and sighed.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” he thought. “She has real ability, if it
could be developed. And to think that she’s the offspring
of such animals as ‘them Oakses’!”</p>

<p>Marion spoke again.</p>

<p>“Down in the city do men say ‘Miss Marryin,’ like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
you do? I thought ’twas jest ‘Miss Oaks,’ or
‘Marry.’”</p>

<p>“It all depends. If you don’t know her well, or if
you don’t want to, you say ‘Miss Oaks.’ If you’re
pretty well acquainted, so that you feel sort of friendly,
it’s ‘Miss Marion.’ You have to be real good friends
to drop the ‘Miss’ part of it. Unless, of course, she’s
only a little girl.”</p>

<p>“I see. I dunno if I like ‘Miss Marryin,’ but
mebbe I do, too. It’s—it’s kind of respectful, ain’t it?
Nobody never spoke respectful to me in my life. It
makes me feel kind of growed-up. But I notice you
keep on sayin’ ‘Miss Marryin’ even after you—after
you hugged me jest now. And that’s only sort of
friendly, you say.”</p>

<p>He opened his mouth to answer, but closed it again.
He did not know just what to say. He felt, too, that
no answer was needed—that she was musing aloud
rather than talking to him. A long pause followed.
Then she spoke, not of herself, but of him.</p>

<p>“I hear you’re livin’ right ’long into Jake’s house.
Ain’t the ha’nt there now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. He’s there. But I’m used to him now.
He never does anything but tramp around and shake
the bed once in awhile, and I sleep pretty well. How’s
Steve? And your pop?”</p>

<p>“Steve—he’s all right. He’s into a good place, and
I see him every day. Pop’s same as usual—drunk
most of the time. But you want to watch out if he
gits sober. He’s p’ison mad at you, ’count of the
dogs. I’m awful glad you kilt them critters. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
were always ugly and I was scairt of ’em. One of ’em
bit you, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Not to amount to anything—nipped my side a
little, but the worst damage was to my shirt.”</p>

<p>She nodded, and went on.</p>

<p>“Pop keeps a-stewin’ ’bout it. And Snake Sanders
is out now, too. Snake, he was all lamed up awhile,
’specially his neck—couldn’t hardly move it for more’n
a week. He says he fell down into the rocks.”</p>

<p>She paused. He said nothing. Then she added:
“But some folks say he got licked by a detective.”</p>

<p>With that she faced about, her eyes twinkling now.
At sight of his wide grin she laughed out.</p>

<p>“Folks sometimes tell the truth,” he admitted. “But
what about Snake and your pop?”</p>

<p>“Well——” She hesitated. “Snake’s got some
kind of a hold onto pop, and they’ve been together a
lot lately, and pop seems to be soberin’ up some. That
sometimes means trouble for somebody. I dunno
what’s up—I keep out of the way when Snake comes
to the house, ’cause I don’t want him pesterin’ round
me. But you better be careful.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Pestering around you? How?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wants me to go and live with him. And
he’s got a woman already—Lou Brackett. She’s been
his woman ’most a year. But I ain’t a-goin’. Pop,
he’d try to make me go, but mom won’t let him. She
hates Snake ’most as bad as I do.”</p>

<p>Douglas gave a soundless whistle. Her matter-of-fact
statement jolted him. Then his face hardened.</p>

<p>“Is he at your house now?” he demanded. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
didn’t come along the road—rambled along the creek—so
I didn’t go past there.”</p>

<p>“What you want to know for?” She swiftly arose.
“You keep away from Nigger Nat’s!”</p>

<p>For answer, he picked up his gun and turned toward
the road. She sprang at him, grasping his arm.</p>

<p>“What you goin’ to do? Tell me!”</p>

<p>“Teach that snake to keep away from your place.”</p>

<p>“No! Listen to me. That’s jest what they’d like.
You go trompin’ into there with a gun and makin’ a
row, and you’d git it—into the back! You keep out.
Let ’em come to you if they want, but you keep out
of Nigger Nat’s. You’ll only make it worse for me
if you go there—me and Steve too.”</p>

<p>The last words stopped him. Frowning, he rubbed
his chin and considered.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows I know you—I ain’t told,” she went
on. “Mebbe I might want a friend all to once,
and so might Steve. A friend that nobody knowed
about might be worth a lot. And till then, I’d git
’long a lot easier if pop and Snake didn’t s’picion
things.”</p>

<p>Slowly he nodded. Again their eyes met and held,
and the frank pleading in the gray ones softened the
chilled-steel glimmer of the blue.</p>

<p>“All right, Marion. I’ll mind—this time. But only
if you promise to come to me any time you need
help.”</p>

<p>The tapering fingers gave his arm a quick pressure.
Then she stood back.</p>

<p>“I promise you. Now you better go ’long—I’ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
to go home pretty quick, and I’ll have to go by my own
self. Go on up the crick, as if I wasn’t here.”</p>

<p>He nodded and turned away. But he turned back.</p>

<p>“Keep right on doing that,” he urged, pointing at
the sketch on the ground. “It’s worth while. You’re
doing fine.”</p>

<p>With that he trudged away. The bushes quietly
closed behind him. The little mouse came out, the
chipmunk whisked in a yellow streak from somewhere
back to his bowlder, the creek sang placidly on. Still
the girl stood looking at the spot where the man had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“He minded me!” she murmured, a soft glow coming
and going in her cheeks. “He minded me—and I
bet he’d sooner fight than eat. And he said ‘Marryin,’
too, not ‘Miss.’ But—but Steve——”</p>

<p>All at once she leaned against the hemlock tree.
And the mouse and the chipmunk stood still and stared
about, seeking a sound which blended into the gurgle
of the creek but was not of it; a new, sad sound which
they never had heard before. It was the sobbing of
a girl.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>AT THE BRIDGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the edge of the water, beside a little bridge
spanning the Kill, Douglas sat on a stone and leisurely
chewed at a sandwich. It was an hour since he had
bidden Marion good-bye and resumed his wandering
way up the stream; and now, though noon was not
quite at hand, he felt that this was the time and the
place to eat. The flat-topped stone was a comfortable
seat, the sun poured its welcome warmth around him,
the pure water flowing past furnished both drink and
finger-bath, and somewhere among the leaves a phœbe-bird
sang to him its sweetly simple little plaint.</p>

<p>So, healthily hungry and pleasantly tired by his
morning ramble to this point, he basked and ruminated
as if it made no difference whether he continued his
upward course along the brook or stayed where he
was until dark. For that matter, it made none. He
was his own man and master, free to come or go or
start or stop as fancy decided; and if he should change
his careless purpose of the morning—to follow the
stream upward to its birthplace in high Lake Minnewaska—no
consequences would follow. What he
did not do to-day he could do to-morrow, or leave forever
undone. It mattered not, so long as one more
care-free day was added to his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>He knew, of course, that soon these golden days
must end. Just as the gray chill of November and the
ensuing cold of winter would presently terminate this
dreamy season of the harvest-time, so the necessity of
doing his share of the work of the world must eventually
drive him forth from the Traps and back to the
hurly-burly of the towns. But the bleak time of the
snows still was weeks away; and so, he hoped, was
the day when he must desert this wild corner of the
hills. Meanwhile, like the squirrels which roved about
in search of supplies to tide them through the bitter
time approaching, he rambled and gathered into the
storehouse of Memory many a mind-picture to feed
his nature-loving soul when he should again be walled
within the clanking city.</p>

<p>Every day since the ending of the “line storm” he
had traveled the Traps. Time and again he had spent
an entire day threading his way over, under, and
around the myriad bowlders lying at the foot of Dickie
Barre’s precipice: some towering on end to the height
of their parent rock itself, bearing mute witness to the
terrific power of the ice of the glacial age, hiding
among them masked chasms seldom seen by human
eyes; some leaning together as if placed by the hands
of some Indian giant whimsically building a rock
wigwam; and countless blocks of every size and shape,
overlying one another at every angle, as if battered
from the face of the butte by the hammer of a mad
Thor.</p>

<p>In the long cliff itself he had found gloomy caverns
and crevices which he did not enter, but which, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
suspected, were by no means unknown to certain men
of the Traps. The days were too short and his progress
through the chaos too slow and arduous to devote
time to an extended exploration of those holes. So he
had viewed their exteriors with a shrewd smile and
passed on. And, though no sound from within those
gloomy portals ever floated to him, perhaps it was as
well that he did pass on.</p>

<p>But he had not spent all his time in that labyrinth,
nor had he passed southward in it beyond the point
where his “catamount girl” had first cried to him in
the night for help. Then she had been coming toward
him from the south, and he felt that in that direction
was her little secret dream-cave, and that not far from
it the fugitive Steve now was hiding. Her secret
should remain her own; he did not wish even to
blunder into it by chance. Instead, he turned his
errant steps in other directions.</p>

<p>Down the Clove road he had gone, visiting the Clove
itself—a flat-bottomed valley through which the Kill
meandered, and where old stone houses hinted at the
Indian days when every settler’s home must be his
fortress. Along the way, and in the Clove, he had met
men who stared with unmasked interest, answered
slowly and briefly when addressed, showed neither
friendliness nor hostility, but seemed relieved when he
moved on. Only one had asked him a question, and
that query was direct and personal.</p>

<p>“Ye’re Hammerless Hampton, ain’t ye?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Hampton,” he had answered. “Why
the Hammerless?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>A slow nod toward his hammerless gun had revealed
the reason for his new name. When he in turn began
asking questions the man had moved away.</p>

<p>Now, ending his meal and dipping up a measure of
water in his tin cup, Hammerless Hampton smiled at
the memory.</p>

<p>“I’m getting to be a sort of desperado,” he mused.
“That nickname sounds like Bowie Bill, or Derringer
Dick, or Six-gun Sam—h’m! or like Snake Sanders.
Hope the citizenry hereabouts doesn’t classify me
along with that reptile. I let him think, before I
punched him, that I was dodging the law, and maybe
he’s spread the idea around. I’d give a big shiny
quarter to know just what I’m supposed to be. I
know I’m a goat, but am I a black one or a white one
or a spotted one?”</p>

<p>Downing the drink, he refilled his cup and set it
beside him on the stone while he loaded his pipe. Then
he looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll move in a few minutes,” he decided.
“I believe the schoolhouse is up yonder at the corner,
and the youngsters will be out soon and chasing down
here, maybe. But I’ve time for a smoke first.”</p>

<p>He glanced along up-stream, under the bridge, as he
lit his pipe. Up that way led an unkempt road debouching
from the sandy track leading across the
bridge, and he decided to follow it part of the way.
Then his eyes lifted, and as they rested on the railing
above him they widened.</p>

<p>Leaning on that rail, watching him, stood a woman.</p>

<p>He had not heard her approach, but she was there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and seemed to have been there several minutes. She
was slatternly, frowsy-haired, olive-skinned, with Indian
cheek-bones and black eyes; garbed in a shapeless,
faded dress, and barefoot. Yet she was quite young
and not without a sensuous comeliness. Now, meeting
his surprised gaze, she slowly smiled as if she had
found her survey of him rather pleasing.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” he said coolly. “Where did you spring
from?”</p>

<p>Her smile widened, revealing the fact that two of
her front teeth had been knocked out.</p>

<p>“Kind o’ caught ye nappin’, hey?” she drawled.
“Was ye waitin’ for somebody?”</p>

<p>He puffed a couple of times before replying, meanwhile
observing that her gaze went a little beyond him
to the gun-barrels glistening in the sun.</p>

<p>“Nope. If I were, I wouldn’t be sitting here in
plain sight.”</p>

<p>She nodded with a bovine air of wisdom.</p>

<p>“Tha’s right,” she agreed. “But what ye lookin’
for? Ther’ ain’t nawthin’ along o’ here.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, let’s see. If I’m looking for anything,
it’s for the place where this brook starts.”</p>

<p>She regarded him with increasing amusement.
Then she laughed outright, her sleek shoulders quivering
as she rocked on her dusty toes.</p>

<p>“I guess so. Yas, I guess so! A lot o’ good that’d
do ye, wouldn’t it now? Ha ha! Be ye findin’ any
cold tea up into the rawcks, mister?”</p>

<p>“Up in the rocks? What makes you think I’ve been
up there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>She looked up the road; down the road; at the
bushy track leading away behind her, up-stream. Reassured,
she laughed down at him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hearn ’bout ye,” she declared. “Some o’
them rawcks has got eyes into ’em, mister. Ye’ve been
up ther’ a-noseyin’ all around. Was ye lookin’ ther’
for the place wher’ this crick starts?”</p>

<p>Again she shook with laughter. Coupled with the
oddity of the missing teeth, her mirth was contagious.
Douglas grinned in answer.</p>

<p>“Nope. Hunting a gold-mine. What did you
think?”</p>

<p>To his surprise, she took the jest seriously. Her
black brows lifted and her wide smile faded. Presently
she nodded in that wise way of hers.</p>

<p>“Ninety-Nine’s Mine!” she said. “But ’tain’t a
gold-mine, mister—it’s silver. An’ it’s fu’ther down
than the place wher’ ye been lookin’—leastways that’s
what folks say. But ye’ll be a long time a-huntin’, I
shouldn’t wonder. Why didn’t ye say so before, ’stead
o’ gittin’ folks all riled up ’cause they didn’t know
what ye was pesterin’ round after?”</p>

<p>He stared, wondering whether she was making game
of him, and decided that she was not. A lost mine!
His blood quickened at the thought. But he kept control
of his face and smiled again casually.</p>

<p>“You’re the first one to ask me what I was doing,”
he told her. “The rest of them decided I was a detective
without asking me, so I let them think what
they liked.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re simple!” she scoffed. “If folks knowed ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
was a-huntin’ the mine they’d jest laff an’ let ye go it,
but seein’ ye a-slidin’ round so quiet an’ not knowin’—wal,
ye can’t blame folks for s’picionin’ things. An’
all to once ye might fall into trouble so hard ye’d never
git outen it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right. But aren’t you wrong about
the silver? I thought it was gold.”</p>

<p>She swallowed the bait whole.</p>

<p>“Nah! Silver, I tell ye. I’d oughter know—I lived
into this place all my life, an’ I hearn the story many’s
the time.</p>

<p>“Ol’ Ninety-Nine—everybody’s forgot what his real
name was, ’twas so long ago—he worked the mine all
by hisself an’ wouldn’t let nobody else know wher’
’twas. Bimeby he turned up missin’, an’ he never
come back. But a long time afterward one o’ the
Injuns round here come to ’Lias Fox an’ ast him to
help him onto somethin’ he couldn’t do alone. ’Lias
he was pretty old, but he was strong an’ willin’, an’
him an’ this Injun went up into the woods down
yender, toward the ledges. An’ when they got up
into the rawcks the Injun blindfolded him ’fore he’d
go any fu’ther ’long.”</p>

<p>She paused suddenly and again looked up and down
the road.</p>

<p>“An’ then he took ’Lias a-stubblin’ round into them
rawcks,” she resumed, “an’ pretty quick ’Lias lost
track o’ wher’ he was. But bimeby the Injun took the
hankercher offen his eyes, an’ he was a-standin’ beside
a big flat rawck like a trap-door, with another rawck
a-stickin’ up beside of it like a marker. Then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Injun got a good stout pry, an’ they got one end under
the flat rawck an’ bore down, an’ the two of ’em
hefted up that rawck an’ wedged it. An’ under it
was a hole with some rawck steps a-runnin’ down an’
into the ledge.</p>

<p>“The Injun he went down into the hole, but he
made ’Lias stay out an’ see the pry didn’t slip. Pretty
quick he come up an’ tied ’Lias’s eyes ag’in, an’ ’Lias
had to let him ’cause he was old an’ the Injun looked
pretty bad. Then the Injun walked him out a ways
an’ left him an’ went back, an’ ’Lias hearn the rawck
go <i>bang</i> down wher’ ’twas before, an’ then the Injun
come back, an’ they went ’long out, with the Injun
ahead.</p>

<p>“’Lias, he got so curious he nigh busted, an’ he
slipped the cloth up an’ peeked. An’ the Injun was
a-carryin’ two big heavy bars o’ silver. ’Lias, he
knowed then he’d been to Ninety-Nine’s Mine. But
he didn’t dast say nawthin’, an’ he pulled down the
hankercher an’ never let on. Bimeby the Injun stopped
an’ took off the cloth, an’ they was out o’ the rawcks
an’ the Injun didn’t have no silver—he’d laid it down
somewheres. He told ’Lias to go home an’ keep his
mouth shet, an’ he’d come back sometime an’ show
’Lias somethin’ that’d make him rich. An’ then he
went back into the rawcks an’ ’Lias went home.</p>

<p>“’Lias, he waited years an’ years, but the Injun
never come back. ’Lias got too old to go huntin’ that
place, but he told his boy Tom ’bout it ’fore he died,
an’ Tom he hunted till he died, but he never did git to
it. An’ Tom’s boys, Will an’ Abner, they hunted too—till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Will got kilt. A piece o’ rawck fell offen the
ledge an’ mashed him all up. Then Abner, he got
scairt an’ never looked no more—he says old Ninety-Nine’s
cuss is onto the place an’ no white man will
ever git that silver. Sence then ’most every man into
the Traps has looked, but nobody found it.”</p>

<p>Her drawl was gone and her tongue flying fast in
the joy of retelling a well-worn tale. Now she suddenly
moved off the bridge and came slipping down
the slope toward him. He arose.</p>

<p>“But ther’s somethin’ that everybody don’t know,”
she added mysteriously. “An’ that’s this—the place
wher’ the sun hits the wall fust into the mornin’, that’s
wher’ Ninety-Nine’s Mine is! Mebbe ye can find it,
mister—don’t tell nobody—but if ye find it ’member
I told ye. Will ye gimme some o’ the silver if ye find
it? I—I wanter git outen this place!”</p>

<p>In the black eyes upturned to his were appeal, revolt,
wistfulness—and, as they continued to look at
him, something else. Unabashed, unmistakable, they
gave him the message that she found him very good
to look on; that he had but to reach for her and take
her. He stepped back a little.</p>

<p>“I’ll do that—if I find it,” he assured her, repressing
a smile. “If ever I stumble into Ninety-Nine’s
Mine I’ll give you a full share of whatever is in it.
Now I think I’ll move——”</p>

<p>He paused. She had started and thrown a scared
glance behind. From up on the hill sounded shouts
and the thud of running feet. School was out.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Gawd—git in under the bridge quick!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
she gasped. “I dasn’t be seen with ye—quick—let
’em git by!”</p>

<p>She tugged at his arm, then jumped for cover under
the bridge. He hesitated, scorning to hide. But she
beckoned imploringly.</p>

<p>“Ye’ll git me into misery!” she quavered. “Don’t
let ’em see ye—they’ll stop an’——”</p>

<p>He yielded to her importunity. Seizing his gun, he
bounded under the planks.</p>

<p>The spatting feet and the childish voices rocketed
down upon them. The boards thumped roaringly, and
into the little tunnel drizzled sand from the cracks.
They were passing by——</p>

<p>Then a boy’s voice shouted:</p>

<p>“Lookit! There’s a tin cup!”</p>

<p>Douglas glowered at the forgotten cup gleaming on
the stone outside. He started to move toward it, intending
to drive or lure the children away without
letting them peer under the bridge and find the woman.
But he was too late.</p>

<p>Down the slope ran two skinny children, boy and
girl, to grab the prize. Their quick eyes darted under
the bridge. They stopped, and, for a second, stood
open-mouthed. Then across their faces shot a cunning
look. Upward they jumped again at top speed,
and into the road their twinkling legs vanished. And
out pealed their voices in malicious glee, screaming at
the other youngsters:</p>

<p>“Hey! Oo-ee! Lookit! That ’ere ’tective feller
has got Snake Sanders’s woman under the bridge!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE LAW COMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas</span> stopped, wheeled, stared at the woman.
In her face now burned dull anger.</p>

<p>“Ther’ now, ye went an’ done it,” she droned.
“Wha’d ye go an’ leave that cup ther’ for? Ye fool!”</p>

<p>“Are you——” He hesitated. “Is that true—what
they’re saying?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yas, it’s true ’nough. I’m Lou Brackett,” she
admitted sullenly. “An’ jest ’cause I stop to say
‘howdy’ ye go an’ git me into this! I’m in for it now.
Cuss the luck!”</p>

<p>“You mean Snake will——”</p>

<p>“Ah, he wunt kill me—I’m too handy. He’ll only
haff kill me. But ther’”—a spark of spirit began to
gleam under the black brows—“I can git the jump
onto him, knowin’ what’s a-comin’. I’ll keep the sadiron
by me, an’ when he comes I’ll——”</p>

<p>She paused abruptly, a new and shrewd look flitting
over her face. All at once she smiled wide and rolled
her eyes at him.</p>

<p>“I know what we can do,” she gurgled. “Don’t ye
want a good housekeeper, mister? I hearn ye live all
by yerself, an’ that ain’t no way for no man to live.
I can cook an’ sew an’ take good care o’ ye, an’—wal,
ye got me into this; now ye’d oughter look out for
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>So taken aback was he that he stood wordless. She
moved toward him. He stepped away. A lucky
thought came to him.</p>

<p>“I’m living with Dalton’s Death,” he solemnly stated.
“You couldn’t live there. The ha’nt walks every
night, knocking on the walls and——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say no more!” she quavered. “I was forgittin’.
Ye’re crazy, livin’ into that house! I’d ruther
stay to Snake’s.”</p>

<p>Inwardly congratulating himself, he sought a line of
escape for her—and found it. Up-stream the bank
was thickly bushed for some distance, and, though the
voices of the children were not far off, they sounded
at a respectable distance. He pointed.</p>

<p>“Go up there,” he directed tersely. “Get well away
and then hide in the brush. I’ll go talk to the kids—tell
them they’re cross-eyed. Oh, and listen—if Snake
acts mean ask him what he’s hanging around Nat
Oaks’ so much for. If you jump on him quick enough
maybe he’ll forget what he hears about this.”</p>

<p>A vindictive glint crept into her eyes.</p>

<p>“So he’s a-pesterin’ ’round ther’, hey? I’ll fix him!
I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Get going!”</p>

<p>With that he stepped out and strode up the bank.
As he expected, the children were grouped several
yards away, eager to spy but afraid to venture too
near the lurking “detective.” At sight of him they retreated,
ready to flee at the slightest threatening movement.
He made none. He had a better plan.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you young folks jabbering about?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
he chaffed them. “Can’t a fellow take a smoke under
a bridge without your getting all excited about it?”</p>

<p>They dug their toes into the dust, warily watching
him. He took a lazy stride, and they gave back instantly—though
they did not run. Pausing, he ostentatiously
puffed at the pipe still smouldering between
his teeth. The ensuing blue haze bore out his claim
that he had been smoking.</p>

<p>“What’s this I heard about Snake Sanders?” he
pursued. “Snake isn’t there.”</p>

<p>Behind he heard a slight splash. The woman was
obeying his command.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t Snake!” yelped the boy who had seen
them. “Snake’s woman! Lou Brackett!”</p>

<p>A mocking chorus swelled out, started by those
farthest back.</p>

<p>“Under the bridge with Loo-ou! Under the bridge
with Loo-ou!”</p>

<p>Another boy, growing bolder, added a further taunt.</p>

<p>“Wait till Snake hears ’bout it! He’ll hop onto
ye! Yah!”</p>

<p>“Yah! Under the bridge with Loo-ou!” piped the
chorus.</p>

<p>The man’s teeth clenched on the pipe-stem, but he
kept smiling.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better be sure you’re right before you
start tattling tales? What do you think Snake’ll do to
you when he finds out you lied to him? And what do
you think <i>I’ll</i> do?”</p>

<p>The sudden hush and scared glances around showed
that the shot struck home. None wanted to incur the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
wrath of Snake Sanders. But the girl who had spied
the hidden pair—a gangling creature with eyes too
close together—snapped back at him.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t no lie! We seen ye—me and Billy!”</p>

<p>“Saw me, yes. But there’s no woman under that
bridge. Why do you yell out that there is? First
thing you know you’ll get yourself into trouble.”</p>

<p>Another hush. The youngsters began scowling at
the pair who had screamed the news.</p>

<p>“She is so!” stubbornly disputed the girl. “I seen
her!”</p>

<p>“Now be careful! Want to bet on it?” He drew
a bright quarter-dollar from a pocket and held it up.
“Want to bet five cents against this quarter that a
woman’s there? Any woman at all. If you bet and
lose, though, I’ll make your teacher get the money
from you or give you a good hiding. Want to bet?”</p>

<p>The half-score pairs of eyes fastened wolfishly on
the gleaming coin. The boy and the girl wavered and
remained silent. There might be some trick, and the
thought of a thrashing was unpleasant. As Douglas
intended, their failure to accept his dare increased the
doubt in the minds of the others.</p>

<p>“You don’t dare to bet,” he laughed sneeringly. “I
thought not. Well, now, just to show you you’re
cross-eyed and didn’t see any woman at all, I’ll let you
look for yourselves. Come on, girls and boys. I
won’t touch you.”</p>

<p>Still they hung back. He drifted slowly toward the
bridge, giving Lou Brackett every possible second of
time while seeming to urge the children on. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
bridge itself he darted a side-glance up-stream. Nobody
was in sight.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he snapped. “I can’t stand here all
day.”</p>

<p>A bolder spirit among the boys edged forward. In
a minute all were coming. Douglas leaned carelessly
on the rail and grinned.</p>

<p>“Look under, everybody! I want you all to see
that I’m telling it straight. Use your own eyes.”</p>

<p>They tumbled down the bank, spied all around, and
came up laughing loudly at the pair of informers.</p>

<p>“She’s gone!” yelled the boy. “She was here but
she run somewheres!”</p>

<p>“Where?” instantly countered Douglas. “You’ve
all been watching this bridge every minute. How
could anybody come out without your seeing him—or
her? Now, you two had better go and get some
glasses. Then maybe you can tell the difference between
a rock under the bridge and a woman. If you
really saw a woman, why didn’t you bet a nickel
against my quarter? Because you didn’t see any.
Isn’t that right, youngsters?”</p>

<p>His confident argument, poor as it was, clinched the
matter in the simple minds of those who had not seen
the woman there. They jeered at the spies, who were
sullenly silent just when they should have fought
back.</p>

<p>“All right, go on,” Douglas waved them away.
“Only remember, if I hear any more about this I’ll
know who told it around, and—you may be sorry.”
This time he gave the sulky pair a hard look. “Now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
run along. I want to finish my smoke without being
yelled at.”</p>

<p>They went, still poking fun at their discredited
companions. For awhile Douglas leaned there, knowing
he was watched, and that while he was the focus
of attention the woman could move farther away unobserved.
Then he knocked out his pipe and sauntered
away, directing his steps up the open road toward the
schoolhouse.</p>

<p>“H’m! That was a sweet mess, wasn’t it?” he
reflected. “Maybe that pair of little scandal-mongers
will keep their mouths shut, but I doubt it. However,
the rest of them didn’t see her, and she’s out of it
with a whole skin—if she has wit enough to get in the
first word when Snake shows up. Mister Ha’nt, up
to the present you’ve been a pest, but now you’re a
friend in need; you got me out of an embarrassing
corner quite gracefully. Consider yourself thanked.”</p>

<p>Chuckling, he swung smoothly along between the
walls of verdure bordering the road, soon reaching a
sharp turn where the road angled off to the westward.
There stood the little dun schoolhouse, now temporarily
deserted. Along both sides of the steep roadway
beyond stood small houses quite close together. At
the nearest of these was a workshop, and before it
toiled an active little man surrounded by new barrels.</p>

<p>Somewhat surprised by the sight of industry at this
lazy noon-hour, Douglas slowed his steps as he approached.
The man was obviously a cooper; and
around one stand of staves he was deftly looping a
withe hoop and locking it tight by notches in the withe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
As Douglas halted he rapidly tapped the hoop down
into position, gave the barrel a roll, and stopped, foxily
watching the stranger.</p>

<p>“Howdy, stranger,” he gurgled, shifting a lumpy
quid in one cheek.</p>

<p>“Howdy. You look busy.”</p>

<p>“Allus busy to this time o’ year—folks needs barrels
for the apples—keeps me a-hustlin’, yessir. But
lawsy, what’s the use o’ livin’ if ye don’t keep a-movin’,
says I. Might’s well be a stump or a rock, yessir.
Some folks’d ruther set and spit tobacker to a rat-hole,
but not me. I’d ruther wear out than rust out—I
can lay quiet a long time when I’m dead. Ain’t that
so?”</p>

<p>“Right as a trivet,” the blond man heartily approved,
noting the keen features and the sandy gray
hair. “I’ll bet you’re a Scotch-Irishman. Am I
right?”</p>

<p>“Wal! Ye hit ’er right into the eye, stranger—David
McCafferty—that’s me. No slow Injun blood
or Dutch into me, like some folks round here—I’m
awake, I am, yessir! Ye’re Hammerless Hampton,
o’ course. Hearn all ’bout ye, oh, yes.”</p>

<p>His shrewd look dwelt a minute on the gun. Then
he shot a wary glance around. His next remark came
in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Uncle Eb told me ’bout ye. Fine old feller, Uncle
Eb. Been to see him yit?”</p>

<p>“No. Haven’t seen him since the line storm. I’ve
been rambling around. Why?”</p>

<p>“Wal, go an’ see him now, if ye ain’t got nothin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
else onto yer hands. He’d oughter be to home pretty
quick—he went out bee-huntin’ to-day early. Soon’s
ye see him tell him Davy says this: there’s two
strangers a-snoopin’ round—come in from the Gap
this mornin’—I seen ’em slide into the brush down
yender by the schoolhouse, an’ they ain’t come back.
Jest tell him that. He’ll know what I mean.”</p>

<p>Douglas turned, looked at the road behind, let his
eyes rove in the direction the strangers must have
taken, and found himself looking at the wall of Dickie
Barre—where Steve probably was hiding. He scowled
and unconsciously shifted his gun. A subdued chuckle
brought his glance back to David, who now was agrin.</p>

<p>“Guess ye think like I do, Hammerless,” he added
with a swift wink. “Anyways, if ye see Uncle Eb
’fore I do, tell him. I been hopin’ he might come
back along o’ here, but nobody knows where he’ll
travel to when he gits a-goin’.”</p>

<p>“Which is his house?”</p>

<p>“’Bout haff a mile ’long—on the left, beyend the
second turn—yeller house facin’ Dickabar—the onliest
yeller house on the <i>left</i> side o’ the road. G’by.”</p>

<p>He dived at his work again, with a back jerk of the
head to urge his messenger on. Douglas swung away
with long strides.</p>

<p>At the other houses along his way faces looked out
from windows as he passed and heads jutted from
doorways when he had gone by, but he did not see
them. His gaze ranged ahead, seeking a yellow house
on the left. His thoughts were a complex of puzzlement
over McCafferty’s cryptic last utterances and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
worriment for Steve. He did not reflect on the fact
that Steve was an escaped convict: he thought of him
only as a hunted victim of the machinations of Snake
Sanders and as the wild young sweetheart of Marion,
and he resented the coming of men who might be
human bloodhounds trailing the unlucky youth. And,
though he wondered why honest Uncle Eb should
need a warning of the presence of those newcomers,
he dismissed the enigma with the guess that this was
only a part of the “underground telegraph” system
of the Traps, whereby its citizens, good or bad, learned
news which might or might not concern them vitally.</p>

<p>Though he did not realize it, he was responding to
his environment. The mysterious undercurrent of
things unseen, half-guessed—of whispers and winks
and silences—of secret movements in the jungly brush
and the labyrinth of stones—was eddying around his
straightforward nature and deflecting him into the
channel where, in time, he might become an integral
part of the walled-in stream of life revolving about the
bowl. Whether he should ride on the surface of that
stream, whether he should float below it like a submerged
snag, whether he should suddenly drop to the
bottom and be forever lost, only time could tell. But
the current was working, and he was drifting with it
unawares.</p>

<p>Less than a month ago, as Douglas Hampton, newspaperman,
he had had a friendly nod and a smile for
every blue-coated patrolman he happened to meet. In
his own neighborhood he had known personally every
“cop,” and some of the plain-clothes “dicks” as well;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and many a time in the dead hours of night, when his
own work was done and policemen had little to do but
patrol vacant beats, he had stood long in some shadowy
corner and yarned with a lonesome guardian of the
law. “A fine bunch of fellows,” had been his opinion
of them then. Yet now, as Hammerless Hampton,
his mental reaction to the hint of the arrival of man-trackers
was instinctively hostile; hostile, though he
himself still was almost universally regarded as a detective.
Yes, he was drifting.</p>

<p>But he was not to drift long. The time was close
at hand when, in his own mind at least, he must align
himself with or against the forces of the law. In
fact, every stride he took was narrowing the distance
between him and that decision. When he turned into
the little dooryard of the only yellow house on the
left, he was within ear-shot of the growling voice of
the Law. And when he tramped noisily up the steps
and looked through the open door at the top he looked
squarely into the eyes of the Law itself.</p>

<p>Beyond that door stood three men. One, his hat
askew on his silvery hair, was Uncle Eb. The other
two, beefy, red-faced, regarding the newcomer with
cold eyes, were obviously outsiders. The civilian
clothing and blunt-toed shoes, the chilled-steel stare,
the untanned hands hovering on a level with the lowest
buttons of their vests, the significant bump bulging the
coat of the nearer man—over the right rear pocket—all
told the same tale to Hampton’s quick survey.</p>

<p>There was no guesswork about it this time. The
Law was in the Traps.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE CODE OF THE HILLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Standing</span> there in the doorway, Douglas watched
the eyes of the two strangers shift rapidly over him,
taking him in from clean-shaven face to laced boots,
then returning to the shotgun under his arm. With a
cool nod to them, he turned to Uncle Eb—and surprised
in the old man’s countenance a look of mingled
anxiety and hope.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Uncle Eb,” he said casually. “Thought
I’d drop in a minute and smoke a pipe. Didn’t know
you had company.”</p>

<p>“Come in! Come right in, son!” The explosive
voice was even more abrupt than usual. “Where ye
been all the time? I been by yer house twice—stopped
to see ye—but ’twas all empty like. I was scairt the
ha’nt might o’ got ye. These fellers—I dunno ’em—they
ain’t no comp’ny o’ mine. I jest got home—been
bee-huntin’—found a good tree, too—bet ther’s a good
fifty pound o’ honey into it—these fellers was jest
a-comin’ into the yard when I come.”</p>

<p>The jerky sentences, the strained look, told Douglas
that Uncle Eb—Uncle Eb, who had previously asserted
that he had no reason to fear detectives—was nervous.
Now he thought he caught a meaning flutter of one
white-lashed lid and a sidewise flicker of the eyes.
But he could not interpret the signal—was not even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
sure it was so intended. So he only nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I’ve been rambling around, or I’d have
seen you sooner. Did you get that tobacco for me at
High Falls?”</p>

<p>The question was a blind for the benefit of the
listening pair. He had given Uncle Eb no commission
to bring him more tobacco, and his present stock was
more than ample. But the old man snatched instantly
at the hint.</p>

<p>“Yas—yas, I did, boy. It’s into my bedroom—I’ll
git it. But I dunno if I got what ye want. Ye didn’t
tell me what kind, so I got two. Come pick what ye
want, an’ I’ll keep t’other for myself.”</p>

<p>He lumbered into another room, Douglas lounging
after. The two strangers made slight movements as
if to follow, then remained where they were. Uncle
Eb had left the door wide open, and the watchers saw
that he was taking tobacco cans from the top of an old-fashioned
chest of drawers: yellow cans and blue ones.</p>

<p>“They’re both slice-cuts,” rattled the old man.
“Some likes one, some wants t’other. Take yer pick.”</p>

<p>Douglas, holding a can in each hand as if considering,
knew by their lightness that no tobacco remained
in them. They were old tins, saved by the thrifty
hillman for any use that might occur to him. He slid
a cornerwise glance at Eb.</p>

<p>“Or take both kinds if ye want—I’ve got some
more.” Then, hardly moving his lips, the old man
breathed: “Steve in barn—go tell him hide in hay!”</p>

<p>Douglas repressed a start. So that was it! Uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Eb, loyal to his people though honest in his own life,
was sheltering the refugee. And he, Hampton, who
previously had had only a passive hand in aiding the
fugitive, now must act either to help or to outwit the
heavy-handed Law standing beyond the doorway.</p>

<p>According to the smug dictum of all self-righteous
society, his duty was plain: to inform the waiting
police that an escaped convict lurked within a stone’s
throw. What matter if he thereby involved Uncle Eb
as an accomplice? What though he tore the heart of
a girl and threw a boy back into a living tomb? A
convict was a convict, duly sentenced by judicial authority,
and those who connived to defeat that authority
must suffer the consequences. And the girl—what
is a girl’s grief to the Law?</p>

<p>Such was the code of Respectability. Confronting
it was the code of the hills, which this old man was
instinctively obeying; the code of natural justice, far
more ancient and human than the chain-clanking machinery
of legislature and court and prison: <i>Stand by
your own!</i> On either side of Douglas Hampton they
towered, stark and hard as the two great walls of the
Traps; and he must either swing on in the Traps
current or turn and fight against it.</p>

<p>To a worshipper of codes, the choice might have
come hard. To this man it was hardly even a matter
for choice. He had his own instinctive code, and
backbone enough to follow it through. And now he
gave no thought to the beliefs and traditions of either
the great world without or the little world within the
mountain bowl. He saw only the desperate face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Steve, heard only the lad’s vehement denial of guilt.
And he spent no time in pondering over his course.</p>

<p>Not more than five seconds passed between Uncle
Eb’s whisper and his first move. He nodded, slid the
empty cans into separate pockets, and turned doorward.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I’ll try ’em both out,” he said. “Pay
you the next time I see you. That all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure, sure, that’s all right—any time, son, any
time. Mebbe I’ll be drivin’ down your way to-morrer,
or anyways the next day—I might go after the honey
to-morrer. Want to set in an’ eat ’fore ye go? I
ain’t much good of a cook, an’ Marthy an’ Becky ain’t
to home to-day—they went a-visitin’—but I got to fix
up sumpthin’ for myself, an’——”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll be going. Had my lunch just a little while
ago.”</p>

<p>“Wal, g’by. Which way ye goin’—up back? Wal,
say, do sumpthin’ for me. Throw down a jag o’ hay
to the hoss when ye go ’long. Much ’bliged.”</p>

<p>Douglas nearly grinned at the old man’s adroitness
in thus openly turning him toward the barn. But he
kept his face expressionless and, with a nod both to
Uncle Eb and to the silent man-hunters, loafed toward
the exit. Then one of the sinister pair moved and
spoke.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” he commanded bruskly. “What
you carryin’ that gun for? This ain’t huntin’ season.”</p>

<p>“No?” was the careless retort. “It’s always hunting
season—for foxes and other vermin.”</p>

<p>The second bristled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Whatcha mean by voimin?” he growled.</p>

<p>Douglas turned an amused face to him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Brooklyn!” he laughed. “This is the foist
time I’ve hoid that Sands-Street accent since I came
up here. How’s your thoist?”</p>

<p>The first grinned at the mimicry of his mate. The
second, though he still looked truculent, blinked.</p>

<p>“Takes an oily boid to catch a woim up here,”
gibed the blond man. “But who’s the woim? I
haven’t hoid of any squoiming around on this toif.”</p>

<p>Whereat the first man chuckled and the second
turned brick-color.</p>

<p>“Whatcha mean by that stuff?” he rasped.
“How’d ya git the idear I was lookin’ for anybody?
You know too much, you do. Come on, now, I guess
me and you’ll have a little talk. And you can lay that
gun down on the floor, see?”</p>

<p>Douglas laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“I know I can—but I won’t. Just go easy, Mister
Bull, and don’t monkey with the works. You’re talking
to a big-town boy now, and that stuff doesn’t go.
And if you think you’re disguised so that I can’t spot
you, think again. Those flatfoot shoes are a dead
give-away, not to mention your hip-bump and your
cop face.”</p>

<p>“Yeah? Guess you’re in the habit of watchin’ for
them things, hey? And whatcha doin’ up here, my
fine boid? Kind of a funny place for a big-town boy
to hang out, ain’t it, huh? What was the last name
you went by?”</p>

<p>He was moving, almost imperceptibly, to get Douglas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
between him and his companion. The blond man
foiled the attempt by taking one swift side-step and
getting his back to the open doorway.</p>

<p>“Don’t make a fool of yourself,” he advised wearily.
“You can’t scare me that way in a year of Sundays.
Just to satisfy you—though it’s none of your business—I’m
Hampton, of the New York <i>Whirl</i>, up here on
a vacation. If you get too obstreperous, Mister Man,
I can give you a lovely write-up when I get back to
town—that kind that may let you out of your job.
Go easy.”</p>

<p>The other halted where he was. The name of the
<i>Whirl</i> and the thinly veiled threat coupled with it
stopped him dead; for it conjured up the vision
dreaded by every officer, even though he may affect to
scoff at it—the possibility of being held up to scorn in
the public prints. He understood now why this fellow
refused to be bulldozed, why he laughed in his face—he
was “one o’ them newspaper guys,” than whom
there is no more nervy and disrespectful tribe on
earth; whose friendship is worth much to any police
officer, and whose enmity is not to be lightly incurred.
Naturally, he did not know that Hampton was no
longer connected with newspaperdom.</p>

<p>“You on the <i>Whoil</i>?” he growled, a crafty light in
his eyes. “Who’s city editor there now?”</p>

<p>“Chapman, of course. Same old grouch he always
was, too.”</p>

<p>The other nodded grudgingly. City Editor Chapman
was known far and wide in both newspaper and
police circles for his uncanny news ability and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
vitriolic temper. This fellow’s knowledge of Chapman
and his impudent assurance carried conviction.</p>

<p>“All right, Hampton. Guess you’re O. K. Know
this fella?” He nodded toward Uncle Eb.</p>

<p>“Sure. He’s as honest as they make ’em. What
are you fellows in here for? Got anything good?”</p>

<p>“Nope—nothin’ you’d want,” was the hasty cover-up.
“I ain’t woikin’ in the big town now—this is a
little up-river stuff. Me and my pal’s jest lookin’
round for some small-fry. Don’t let us keep ya. So
long.”</p>

<p>Douglas laughed openly. The burly man now was
even more anxious to be rid of him than he was to go
to the barn.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right. Let’s see, who did you say you
were? And from where?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t say. So long, fella. So long.”</p>

<p>He turned his back squarely on his questioner. The
other man, who had been searchingly watching
Douglas, now directed his gaze elsewhere and also
turned an aloof shoulder to him. Douglas shot a wink
at Uncle Eb and strolled out.</p>

<p>“G’by, son,” called the old man. “Don’t forgit the
hoss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure. I’ll fix him up. See you later.”</p>

<p>With lazy step he sauntered up to the little yellow
barn, whose sliding door stood open a few inches.
Once inside, he dropped his languid air in a flash.</p>

<p>“Steve!” he called softly, peering around.
“Steve!”</p>

<p>No answer came. In a dark stall a horse moved and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
stamped. Somewhere down below sounded the grunts
of hogs which had heard his steps. But of human
movement, of human voice, there was no sign.</p>

<p>“Steve!” he whispered loudly. “Where are you?
Get into the hay! Quick!”</p>

<p>Again there was no sound. But movement came.
Under a stair-flight leading aloft in the dimmest corner,
something slipped cautiously into sight—first an
ear, then a cheek, then a peeping eye. It hung there,
waist-high, watching the man go squinting into the
stalls and around him.</p>

<p>“Steve! This is Hamp! Uncle Eb says——”</p>

<p>“Awright!”</p>

<p>The whispered reply, hoarse and penetrating, cut
short his speech and turned him stairward. The eye
became two, and the face rose as if the concealed
youth were getting up from his knees.</p>

<p>“What’s he say?” demanded Steve.</p>

<p>“Get into the hay! Two bulls are here—in the
house—may come here any minute—get under cover
quick.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.” Steve darted forth. “I seen ’em.
Figgered I better hide into this ’ere hole an’ mebbe
duck out if they went up ’bove. Would of skipped
outen here, but the side house-winder looks right to
the barn an’ I ’spicioned they’d see me.”</p>

<p>He was already on his way upward. Douglas followed
close behind. They emerged into a small hay-loft,
crammed with the season’s crop of horse-fodder.
At each end, high up in the peak but now level with
the piled hay, a small window let in light. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
that light the two stood an instant looking at each
other.</p>

<p>Though the desperate look of the hunted still was on
the fugitive’s face, he looked far better than when
Douglas had carried him into the den among the
bowlders. Then he had been wan, pinched, utterly
exhausted. Now his cheeks were more round, his eyes
unrimmed by blue crescents, his swarthy skin tinged
by healthy color. Food and sleep in plenty had transformed
him from a hatchet-faced wreck to a not unhandsome
young man. But the hard set of the mouth
and the glitter of the dark eyes still were there.</p>

<p>“I’ll never go back!” he whispered fiercely. “I
had three years o’ misery—for a job I never done—an’
them dicks wunt git me back. I’ll kill ’em—I’ll
git shot—I’ll jump offen the ledges an’ bust my neck—anythin’—but
I ain’t a-goin’ back! An’ I got to git
Snake ’fore anybody gits me. I—— <i>Shuh!</i> What’s
that? They comin’?”</p>

<p>He bounded up on the great mound and peered out.
Douglas flashed a glance around. His eyes halted on
the other window—the rear one. It was open.</p>

<p>“They’re a-comin’! They’re a-going to look round
into here! I got to git under!”</p>

<p>Outside sounded Uncle Eb’s loud voice, angrily protesting
against search of his premises. The two man-trailers
were stonily silent.</p>

<p>“No!” decided Douglas. “If they’re suspicious
they’ll look in the hay. You get outside! Through
that window—I’ll steady you—swing up over the eaves
and hug the roof. And lie quiet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Steve, with the ruthless Law almost upon him,
blindly obeyed. Across to the rear window they
plunged over the hay. The boy wriggled through the
opening, turned his face inward, reached for the eaves
above. Douglas braced himself, grasped the bare
ankles, heaved upward. A clawing sound above—a
spasmodic kick—a squirming struggle—the legs broke
free and vanished. Followed a soft bump or two, a
short scraping sound—and silence.</p>

<p>“I tell ye, ye ain’t got no right into my place without
a search warrant!” stormed Uncle Eb below. “I
ain’t got nothin’ to hide, but I got the same rights any
other honest man’s got. Show yer warrant! I forbid
ye into this place!”</p>

<p>“Ah, call in yer lawyer and we’ll talk to him,”
sounded the sneering answer. “Go sit down and hold
yer head. We won’t damage nothin’. Looks bad, too,
you gittin’ so woiked up when you got nothin’ to hide.
Hey, Ward?”</p>

<p>Douglas reached down and rapidly loosened the
lacing of one boot. Then he went back across the
hay and sat down. At once a heavy foot sounded on
the stairs.</p>

<p>“Hey, up there! You, Hampton?”</p>

<p>“Right both times—there’s hay up here, and I’m
Hampton,” drawled the man above.</p>

<p>“Huh! Bill, go up and take a look. I’ll see that
nothin’ slides out down here.”</p>

<p>The red face of Bill, ex-Brooklynite, rose above the
floor, glowering around.</p>

<p>“Well, whatcha doin’, Hampton?” he growled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
“Thought ya was feedin’ the horse, but I notice he
ain’t fed yet. Slow, ain’t ya?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I take my time. And right now I’m straightening
up my sock. Ever have a sock wrinkle under
your heel? Makes a beautiful blister. Horses can
wait until my foot is fixed to suit me.”</p>

<p>Red-Face grunted and keenly surveyed the mow.
Douglas coolly laced up the boot, as if completing
what he had been doing when interrupted; stretched
his leg, worked his foot up and down, and nodded as
if satisfied.</p>

<p>“That feels better,” he announced. “Well, Statue
of Liberty, what’s all the heavy thinking about? Or
are you only trying to look wise and pretending to
think?”</p>

<p>The other’s heavy mouth twisted in an ugly grin.
He reached for a pitchfork standing near, yanked it
free from the hay, inspected its long gleaming tines.</p>

<p>“Funny as a toothache, ain’t ya! One of these days,
fella, that mouth o’ yourn’ll git ya into a box,” he
predicted. “Right now I got other things to poke
into. Jest come down off that hay—unless you’re
coverin’ somethin’ up. That’s right. Ya mind like
ma’s angel-face, don’t ya? Now watch what I toin
up!”</p>

<p>With a leap he came up. And with a shrewd jab
he drove the fork down into the hay on which Douglas
had been sitting.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>COLD NERVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span> and again the man-hunter stabbed at the hay,
moving about with each new attack, lunging more
viciously as his searching prods brought no result.
Douglas felt a little chilly as he visualized what might
have happened if Uncle Eb’s advice had not been disregarded
at the last minute. And the old man down
below, hearing the loud rustle of the dried grass and
knowing nothing of the change in Steve’s place of
refuge, lost his grip on himself.</p>

<p>With a yell he came thundering up the stairs, his
walrus mustache bristling like tusks and his jaw jutting
as if about to bite.</p>

<p>“<i>Git</i> often that hay!” he bellowed. “<i>Git</i> outen
here! An’ git quick, ’fore I muckle onto ye. I’ll
sling ye head-fust outen the winder! <i>Git!</i>”</p>

<p>The man above had jumped about and swung the
fork menacingly before him. Infuriated still further
by the sight of his own hay-tool turned against him,
the old warrior sprang up the sloping side of the mow,
panting inarticulate threats. But he collided with
Douglas, who slid down at him and clinched.</p>

<p>“Hold your horses, Uncle Eb!” he exhorted.
“He’s not hurting the hay or smoking in it—only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
jabbing the fork into it, for some reason or other.
Let him fool around. Whoa! Quiet down!”</p>

<p>But Eb’s blood was up, and he knew no reason why
he should quiet down. He fought to break free, and
the younger man found his hands very full. Tussling
mightily, they reeled about at the foot of the slope, in
imminent danger of slipping over the edge of the open
gap in the floor and crashing down the steep stairs. The
man Ward, who had bounded part-way up to aid his
companion if necessary, took one look and hastily got
from under. His mate Bill, still holding the fork
poised for defense, grinned nastily at the grappling
pair.</p>

<p>Douglas got his chin on Eb’s shoulder and ventured
a whisper from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>“It’s all right. He’s not there.”</p>

<p>It took some seconds for his meaning to penetrate
the old fellow’s raging brain, but Douglas managed to
hold him until he understood. Then all at once he
ceased struggling. Too, he quick-wittedly gave a deceptive
excuse for his outbreak.</p>

<p>“Fellers come into here—actin’ like they was the
King o’ Rooshia an’ I was a dawg,” he panted. “Ain’t
got no search warrant—think they can sass me right
into my own house—tromp onto my hay an’ spile it
for the hosses—they got to git out!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too,” Douglas nodded. “I know how
you feel. But the best way is to let the smart-Alecks
show themselves that they’re wrong—and then, if they
don’t apologize, report them to the right authorities.
I can tell you where to send the report.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>At that Bill glowered anew. He glowered still more
when Douglas turned to him with sarcastic permission
to continue.</p>

<p>“You, up there, go on amusing yourself if you like.
Mr. Wilham here will take his amusement later—when
you’re trying to explain to your superiors why you
took it on yourselves to molest a peaceable citizen.
Maybe he’ll get more fun out of it in the long run
than you will. So go ahead playing hay-maker—it’s a
nice game for little boys. When you get through,
bring down a forkful for the horse. It’ll save me the
trouble.”</p>

<p>Bill’s mouth became a thin line. He looked as if
about to heave the fork at his tormentor. But after
one long glare he doggedly returned to his search,
speaking not a word. Had any fugitive been under
that hay now, however, he would undoubtedly have
died under the vindictive lunges of the fork.</p>

<p>Foot by foot he bayoneted the mow, from end to
end and from side to side. Douglas watched with a
tantalizing grin, Uncle Eb in silent perturbation—wondering
where Steve was but not daring to ask by
word or look. From above came no sound. Steve was
lying quiet as the dead.</p>

<p>In Hampton’s mind grew a big suspicion. These
men were conducting themselves as if acting on previous
information: as if told by some one that here
they would find what they sought. It was preposterous
to suppose that they would go thus through the
entire Traps, jabbing every hay-loft, riding rough-shod
over every man’s right to call his home his castle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
They had come in only that morning, gone up toward
the bowlders—and then come to the one place where
the refugee was. It might be blind chance, but—yes,
Douglas was suspicious.</p>

<p>Finally the man Bill, with an oath, threw down the
fork. His face was redder than ever, streaked with
sweat, itching from hay-dust. He mopped a hand
over his prickly cheeks, scratched his head violently,
bent a baleful glare on the two below. Then he came
wallowing out of the ragged mass he had stirred up.</p>

<p>“Say, bring along that horse-feed, will you? We’ve
been waiting long enough,” complained Douglas. As
if in emphasis, an impatient whinny sounded below.</p>

<p>Another oath exploded from the badgered Bill. He
slid clumsily down and stood looking as if aching to
punch the grinning mouth. But he did not punch.
Swallowing something, he pointed downward.</p>

<p>“Git down-stairs!” he rasped. “You, Hampton,
you got in here foist, but ya’ll stay where I can see ya
from now on. G’wan! Move!”</p>

<p>The blue eyes narrowed at the dictatorial tone and
the half-spoken accusation. But then Douglas smiled
again—an exasperating smile.</p>

<p>“<i>When</i> I’ve fed the horse,” he singsonged. “<i>Then</i>,
if I feel like it. But there, Uncle Eb, maybe you’d
better do the feeding, now that you’re here. If I laid
this gun down I might lose it. Some folks can’t be
trusted.”</p>

<p>Uncle Eb cackled harshly. Bill moved his right arm
quickly, but stopped it. Douglas still smiled, but his
eyes were cold and his gun gripped in a ready-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
fist. Ward, whose head had risen again on the stairs,
watched like a cat, one hand under his coat.</p>

<p>Deliberately Uncle Eb gathered a big armful of hay,
crowded past Bill with it, dropped it on the open chute
to the horse’s bin and stuffed it down with a small
two-tined fork standing at hand. Then he returned to
the stairs and clumped down them, Ward giving way
but holding his position.</p>

<p>“After you, my dear Bill,” bowed Douglas. “Oh,
don’t be afraid. The <i>Whirl</i> may jump on your neck
one of these days, but not this afternoon. G’wan!”</p>

<p>At the patrolman-like twang of the last word Ward
grinned slightly. He evidently had a sense of humor.
Bill looked at him, at Douglas—then trod to the stairs
and down. Douglas followed.</p>

<p>Below, the pair conducted a rapid but extremely
thorough search of the ground floor. Meal-chests,
barrels, stalls, the covert under the stairs—every nook
and corner where a man could possibly be hidden was
looked into. When they still found no sign of what
they sought, they paused and looked hard at each
other.</p>

<p>“Any cellar under here?” demanded Ward.</p>

<p>“If ye call a hawg-pen a cellar, yas,” snapped Uncle
Eb. “Go look into it—waller round into it—ask the
hawgs what they had for breakfas’—wait awhile an’
mebbe I’ll feed ye some swill along with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Say, whatcha mean by that?” snarled Bill.</p>

<p>“I mean ye was brought up into a hawg-pen an’
that’s where ye belong!” flared Eb. “That plain
’nough for ye?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>It was. Bill started for the old man. But Douglas
stepped between them. He said nothing; he only
looked. Bill liked the look so ill that he slowed, then
stopped.</p>

<p>“An’ after ye’ve shook hands with yer brothers ye
can come an’ go all over the house, like ye was goin’
to when ye got s’picious an’ follered Hampton down
here,” jeered Eb. “I don’t let pigs into my house as
a gin’ral thing, but——”</p>

<p>“That’ll be about enough of that!” Ward broke in.
“Keep a civil tongue in your head.”</p>

<p>“—But this once, I’ll do it, seein’ ye’ve gone so fur
now,” Uncle Eb continued, ignoring him. “I can air
out the house when ye’re gone. Hurry up now. Look
under the beds an’ into the oven an’ all—an’ then git
often my land an’ stay off!”</p>

<p>The two looked keenly at him for a full half-minute.</p>

<p>“Since you’re so willing, we won’t,” announced
Ward. Bill nodded sulkily, looking again around the
barn. Ward rubbed his jowl and spat on the floor.</p>

<p>“What d’you make of it, Bill?” he puzzled.</p>

<p>“Somebody lied!” was the morose answer.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Looks like it. Well, let’s travel.”</p>

<p>Douglas, shrewdly watching, loosed a snap shot.</p>

<p>“Don’t you fellows know any better than to believe
Sanders?”</p>

<p>The slight start, the involuntary flicker of the eyelids,
told him that his shot had scored.</p>

<p>“Uh—whatcha mean? We ain’t seen Sanders,”
blurted Bill.</p>

<p>“No? I notice that you know his name, though.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
How much did he shake you down for? You’d better
get it back, quick.”</p>

<p>The pair scowled at each other. Bill, with a growl,
started for the door. Ward halted him.</p>

<p>“Hold up, Bill. No hurry,” he said. “What about
Sanders, Hampton?”</p>

<p>“Only this much: Folks around here think I’m a
detective. Sanders thought so too. He offered to get
me any man I wanted—for half the reward. If the
man wasn’t here, he offered to sell me some fellow
who hadn’t done anything but who could be railroaded—for
the right price. He bragged that he could sell
anybody, and that he’d done that kind of business before.
Does that line of talk sound familiar?”</p>

<p>The scowls grew deeper.</p>

<p>“Some of it,” Ward admitted. “Not the railroad
part of it, but—some of it. Well, say, Hampton, I’m
sure obliged to you for that. Sell anybody, eh? That
means the fellow he’s dealing with, too. Uh-huh.
Bill, let’s you and me take a walk.”</p>

<p>Bill, with another growl, started forward again.
But Douglas was not yet through.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you forgetting something?” he asked
pointedly, moving his head toward Uncle Eb.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Ward acknowledged. “I’m sorry,
Mr.—uh—Williams—Wilson——”</p>

<p>“Wilham!” barked Eb. “I ain’t got nothin’ ag’in
you. It’s this here hawg.” His frosty eyes glinted at
the offensive Bill.</p>

<p>“How about it, Bill?” queried Ward, his tongue
in his cheek.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Bill turned sourly, heavy jaw set. But he attempted
amends.</p>

<p>“Sorry, old fella,” he mumbled. “We got a bad
steer. We ain’t hoit ya, have we? We gotta do our
dooty. We—uh——”</p>

<p>“All right, let it go at that,” Douglas interposed.
All four moved out of the barn. As they emerged,
Douglas began speaking a little louder, so that Steve
could hear. And, to keep the pair from glancing back
and perhaps seeing what was on the roof, he walked
toward the house, talking over one shoulder.</p>

<p>“If you want to find Sanders, you’d better go
straight down the road and hunt his house. He’ll
probably be there at meal-time, if not before. Where
does he live, Uncle Eb?”</p>

<p>“Way over t’other side, not sech a long ways from
the Gap,” Eb answered readily. “He comes an’ goes
by cross-cuts, but ye better stick to the road. Ye turn
into the Clove road down past the schoolhouse, keep
on till ye’ve crossed the crick twice—it sorter wanders
round an’ ther’s bridges acrost—an’ then ther’s a kind
of a wood-road bearin’ off to yer right. Go up that
an’ ye’ll find Snake’s house. Ye’ll be ’bout the onliest
comp’ny thar. Nobody visits much with Snake.”</p>

<p>They were turning into the dooryard before the
house now, Bill and Ward morosely eyeing the road
and trying to fix in mind the unfamiliar turns as described
by Uncle Eb. Douglas stole a glance beyond
them. One side of the barn roof was in plain sight
now. And on that side, a quarter of the way down,
was Steve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Hugging the shingles, he was craftily working eavesward
from the ridge to which he had clung. With
bare toes and flattened hands holding him from too
sudden a slip down the pitch, he was sliding himself
lower and lower on his stomach. When he should
reach the eaves, it would be only a matter of a short
drop to the ground and a quick jump around the corner,
and he would be out of sight. But if his pursuers
should happen to look that way now——</p>

<p>“Look here,” Douglas said quickly, stooping and
tracing a line with his gun-butt, “here’s the road.
Now you go down this way, and then——”</p>

<p>Moving the weapon, keeping his eyes glued to his
crude map, he talked on, holding their attention. They
followed every move. And behind them the ragged
figure on the barn roof descended until its feet hung
out over the eaves. There it hesitated an instant,
balancing itself for the final slip and drop.</p>

<p>Douglas dared not look. Playing for time, he appealed
to Uncle Eb for information regarding some
fictitious road which might branch off before the right
one should be reached. Eb’s eyes were crinkled with
amusement, for he saw that the younger man was inventing
most of his road-map; but he kept his face
straight, disputed a couple of turns, and put down
a gnarled finger to make a new section of the
course.</p>

<p>Bill began to stir impatiently. His eyes wandered.</p>

<p>“Yeah, we’ll git there,” he broke in. “Come on,
Ward.”</p>

<p>“When you get there, look out for snakes!” warned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Douglas, striking for his wandering attention. He got
it. Bill faced him again.</p>

<p>“Snakes! Whatcha mean?”</p>

<p>“Sanders has a fondness for snakes—bad ones.
He may have a few around where you can step on
them. Keep your eyes peeled.”</p>

<p>At that moment sounded a soft thump at the side
of the barn. Ward started to turn.</p>

<p>“Copperheads—rattlers—poisonous!” asserted
Douglas loudly. “Watch out for ’em!”</p>

<p>Ward’s eyes hung on his a couple of seconds longer,
held by the warning. Then he turned and looked toward
the barn.</p>

<p>“What’s that bump?” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Horse moving around, or a hog down below.
Don’t forget those snakes.”</p>

<p>Then Douglas looked. Only the old barn met his
anxious gaze. Ward, after a speculative glance
around, nodded and started away.</p>

<p>“All right. See you later, maybe. So long.”</p>

<p>Followed by Bill, he stepped briskly to the road.
Along the lumpy wheel-ruts in the sand they trudged,
their voices floating back in growling tones that boded
ill for somebody. Then the roadside brush-growth
blotted out their receding figures, and the only sound
was the cheerful chorus of the crickets in the grass.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>FIRE AND FROST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas</span> took a long breath. Uncle Eb swung to
him.</p>

<p>“Wha’d ye do with him?” he hoarsely asked.</p>

<p>In guarded tones Douglas outlined the ruse which
had saved Steve. As he finished he strode out to the
side of the road and looked down it. The two man-hunters
still were in sight, plodding along without a
backward look.</p>

<p>“By mighty! Ye’ve got a head onto ye like a tack,
son,” congratulated Eb, who had followed. “Right
after I told them fellers to look into the hawg-pen I
nigh got a shock—it come to me ye might of hid the
boy into thar. Thank Gawd ye was here—I dunno
what I’d done without ye——”</p>

<p>“All right. Now listen. You go back and get
Steve under cover again quick. Those fellows may
not be so well convinced as they seem to be, and they
might double back after they’re out of sight. I’m going
to follow them up now and see if they keep on
going. I’ll be back.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Bill and Ward faded from sight around
a little curve. He strode away after them. Uncle Eb
hastened to the barn.</p>

<p>Along the straight open stretch of road—perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
forty yards from house to curve—Douglas traveled
at a half-lope. As he went, a smile grew on his mouth,
culminating in a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Hammerless Hampton, you’re an obstructionist, a
conspirator against the majesty of the law, a disreputable
character all around,” he told himself.
“And sooner or later—probably sooner—you’re going
to get yourself in bad. When Brooklyn Bill gets back
to the river, for instance, he may query New York
and learn that you’re disowned by the <i>Whirl</i>, and so
on. And then what?”</p>

<p>Instead of growing serious at the thought of that
possibility, however, he laughed all the more as he
imagined Bill’s lurid language on learning that he had
been duped. He was still laughing when he reached
the bend. But there, in one instant, his face froze.</p>

<p>A few rods farther on stood the pair of officers.
Their backs were toward him, their shoulders touched,
their burly bodies blocked the narrow way. Beyond
their legs showed a skirt.</p>

<p>The skirt was jerking about, and under it bare
ankles moved quickly, as if the woman or girl were
struggling to get away. The shoulders of one of the
men, too, moved as if his hands were gripping an
active prisoner. Then the men swung apart an instant,
and in the space between them gleamed sunlit
red hair.</p>

<p>Douglas bounded forward, his feet making little
noise in the soft sand. Before the intent couple heard
him he was upon them. Straight between them he
plunged, shoving them violently asunder. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
girl broke a cry. She was Marion, and both her
wrists were clutched in the heavy fists of Bill.</p>

<p>“Hey! Ya big bum, whatcha doin’?” Bill blared
furiously. Ward’s face too was dark with anger over
the thump he had received, and one hand hung menacingly
at his hip.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you mighty sudden what I’m doing! Let
her go!”</p>

<p>Bill released the girl—but not in obedience to the
command. He did it because he wanted to use his
hands on Douglas more than on her. Ugly-jawed, he
stepped forward.</p>

<p>Douglas stepped back, handed his gun to Marion,
and fronted Bill with fists poised for the first parry
and counter-punch. Marion sprang aside, face ablaze
with wrath, gun up. Ward, seeing Douglas give up
the weapon to her and stand bare-handed, relaxed
from his tense poise and swiftly grew cool.</p>

<p>Bill shot a vicious punch at the blond man’s chin—a
straight drive which would have downed his man
if it had landed. But Douglas ducked to the left and
snapped a retaliating right for the beefy jaw. It
halted short—his wrist caught and held by Ward.
Now Ward yanked him back.</p>

<p>“Two to one, eh?” raged Douglas. “All
right——”</p>

<p>“No!” clipped Ward. Gripping the blond man’s
arms, he swung himself between the antagonists.
“Let up! Same goes for you, Bill! Cut it!”</p>

<p>With a powerful shove he sent Douglas staggering
backward, at the same time releasing his hold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“That’ll be about all!” he snapped. “Drop this
where it is.”</p>

<p>“I’m not dropping it!” panted Douglas. “Man-handling
girls may get by down where you come from,
but it doesn’t go with me. Officers? Pah! You
cheap thugs——”</p>

<p>“That’ll do!” Ward repeated. “You listen to me
a minute.”</p>

<p>His steady gaze, his resolute tone, his quiet authority,
had their effect. Despite himself, Douglas respected
the man. He stood still.</p>

<p>“I ain’t blamin’ you,” Ward continued evenly.
“You act like a man. But the girl brought it on herself—and
she ain’t hurt a bit. Bill oughtn’t have
grabbed her, maybe, but that’s his way. I don’t like it
myself—him and me have had words about that kind
of stuff before—but the girl ain’t hurt and she
wouldn’t be hurt, whether you butted in or not. We
only asked her somethin’ about the road, and she
sassed us and tried to shove Bill off into the ditch. He
grabbed her hands and told her to learn some manners,
and then she tried to fight him, so naturally he
hung onto her. That’s all there is to it. I’d drop it,
if I was you.”</p>

<p>Douglas looked at her. True enough, she showed
no sign of hurt, except perhaps to her vivid temper.
Ward’s straightforward manner was convincing. So
were the memories of his own denunciation by the
girl on the night when he had met her and of her fiery
fight that morning to regain her sketch. And so were
the words of Marion herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“You big hog!” she flared, holding the gun pointed
at Bill as if aching to use it. “You better git outen
the Traps and stay out! My manners are good enough
for me and my folks, and if you wasn’t brought up to
give other folks half of the road you can’t learn me
anything. You keep on actin’ like you started, and
somebody’ll shoot some manners into <i>you</i>, I shouldn’t
wonder. I’ve got a good mind to do it my own self!”</p>

<p>Under the lash of her tongue, the blaze of her eyes,
and the menace of the twin muzzles yawning at his
midriff, Bill blinked rapidly and stepped backward.
Ward too looked uneasy—for an angry woman and a
gun make a decidedly dangerous combination; the
more so, because the woman may shoot without actually
realizing what she is doing.</p>

<p>“That gun loaded?” he muttered to Douglas.</p>

<p>“Sure. But the safety’s on and she doesn’t know
the mechanism. Of course, she might accidentally
slip it, and then—your pal wouldn’t look very good.
I’d advise you two to make tracks down the road and
keep on making them. And one word more to you,
Ward. You talk straight, and I’ll let this drop for
now; but you’d better pick another running-mate before
you go again among hill people. This man might
do as a Bowery cop or a prison guard, but he’s no good
in wildcat country.”</p>

<p>Ward nodded about a quarter of an inch, as if he
agreed, and studied his mate with a slightly disgusted
look. Then he shrewdly appraised the girl behind the
gun. When he spoke again there was a little twinkle
of admiration in his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Wildcat country’s right. Don’t blame you for
hangin’ around this neck of the woods, Hampton.
Don’t blame you a-tall. Well, so long. Bill!”</p>

<p>The last word crackled. Bill, still edging away from
the gaping muzzles, obeyed Ward’s thumb-jerk along
the road. Passing Douglas, he paused to glower
hatefully into the slitted blue eyes watching him.
Then he shuffled onward.</p>

<p>Not until they had rounded another turn did
Douglas take his unswerving gaze from their backs.
Then, as he relaxed, he realized that Ward had shown
no suspicion over his sudden appearance; recalled,
too, the twinkle and the parting remarks. The man
had thought he and Marion had a tryst. Could he
have looked back through the trees, however, and
studied the girl, he would have begun to wonder.</p>

<p>Douglas, too, wondered as he looked at her. The
snap of anger had vanished from her eyes, the flush
from her cheeks, the girlishness from her figure. The
gray orbs watching him now were cold as ice—ice
with a smouldering flame far below its surface. Her
face and her poise were as stony as any upright bowlder
standing under Dickie Barre. From one hand
hung his gun, its muzzles now buried in the sand.
Straight, forbidding, she stood looking fixedly at him.
And, though he was not expecting any thanks for what
he had done, he stood staring blankly back at her.
This was a girl whom he never had seen before.</p>

<p>“Well! What’s wrong?” he puzzled. “Seems to
be a sudden frost.”</p>

<p>Unspeaking, she lifted the gun and held it toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
him. He took it, peered at it as if seeking on it the
cause of her hauteur, looked up and found her turning
away. She took half a dozen steps toward the Wilham
home, straight as an Indian, proud as a princess,
before he moved. Then he began striding after her.
At once she stopped.</p>

<p>“Thought you was goin’ the other way,” she said
pointedly.</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, I’m going this way now.”</p>

<p>“I’d ruther you’d go on to where you started for.”</p>

<p>His mouth tightened a little.</p>

<p>“I would,” he coolly informed her, “but I told
Uncle Eb I’d come back.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Then I’ll wait. Go ’long.”</p>

<p>Again he stared. As before, she met him eye to
eye, cold and uncompromising.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Marion?” he repeated. “I don’t
understand.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? I should think you might, if you’d
think back a little ways. Now I don’t want to walk
with you.”</p>

<p>His chin lifted. “Oh. I see. It’s Steve. All
right. But if he’s still at Uncle Eb’s I’ll tell him
you’re coming. I won’t be there long.”</p>

<p>She started.</p>

<p>“No—what—how’d you know he’s—what you got
to do with Steve?”</p>

<p>“Ask Steve. He’ll tell you all about it. Good-day.”</p>

<p>With that he was off. She stood motionless, watching
his receding shoulders, her head lifted at the same
proud angle. But, as he disappeared around the curve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
from which he had sprung to her rescue, that haughty
head slowly drooped. She set her teeth into one red
lip. The clear gray eyes became blurred with tears.</p>

<p>Beyond the curve, Douglas stalked rapidly on. Into
the Wilham yard he marched with never a backward
glance, and, after a quick look toward the barn, up
into the open doorway of the house. Uncle Eb, cheek
bulging with a chunk of bread-and-cheese, nodded to
him from the table where he was devouring his belated
cold lunch.</p>

<p>“Shet the door,” he suggested. Douglas closed it.
“Them fellers gone?”</p>

<p>“They’re on their way. They’re sore at each other
now, as well as at Sanders. Where’s our friend?”</p>

<p>“Down cellar. Ther’s a winder he can git out by if
he has to. What’s them fellers mad ’bout now?”</p>

<p>Douglas briefly told him. Uncle Eb stopped chewing,
looked at him keenly, cackled out all at once, then
wondered: “Why didn’t Marry come ’long with ye?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Said she didn’t want to walk with
me. So I jest walked right ’long by my own self.”</p>

<p>The old man looked quizzically at him, then cackled
again.</p>

<p>“Ye’re a-gittin’ to talk like ye b’longed into the
Traps,” he chuckled. “An’ after what ye done this
afternoon, boy, ye do b’long! ’Most anybody with the
right kind of a heart round here would a-helped that
pore misfortunit boy, but ’tain’t every feller from outside,
like you, would a-done it. An’ that Marry gal—she
prob’ly thinks ye’re a detective, like the rest.
She’ll soon know diff’rent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Never mind. But now, Uncle Eb, I don’t like to
ask questions that don’t concern me, but just what
did Steve do that sent him to the pen?”</p>

<p>Uncle Eb hesitated, chewed hard, swallowed, and
gulped a noisy drink of cold coffee.</p>

<p>“The wust thing into the world, son—he got caught.
He never done no harm, but gittin’ caught for a thing
is ’nough, whether ye done it or not. S’posin’ we let
him talk for hisself.”</p>

<p>He stamped twice on the floor. A couple of minutes
later a door silently opened and Steve stepped up from
the cellar stairs. After one glance he leaped to
Douglas’ side and gripped his hand.</p>

<p>“Hamp!” he gulped. “Ye’re a white man! I
ain’t a-goin’ to forgit this. Jest wait till I git my
chance to pay ye some way——”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it! Man alive, I don’t want any pay.
If you owe anything to anybody it’s to Uncle Eb, not
to me. I just blundered in and had a lot of fun with
those fellows. Uncle Eb’s the one to thank.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-forgittin’ Uncle Eb—he knows it. But
the way ye took holt——”</p>

<p>“All right, all right, let it slide. But now, if you
don’t mind telling me, what’s it all about? What are
those fellows after you for? Don’t tell me if you
don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t ye know? Wal, if that ain’t—— Ye
jest went ahead an’ helped me anyways, huh? My
Gawd! I didn’t s’pose there was sech folks into the
world.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, Hamp. We pick a lot o’ berries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
round here into the summer—not right here into the
Traps, but ’way over to Long Pond an’ miles an’ miles
further ’long the mount’ins—an’ sell ’em to dealers.
An’ other fellers come from down b’low to do the same—it’d
take a hull army to pick ’em all, they’re so thick.
Some o’ them fellers are pretty hard. An’ when some
of us folks from here was pickin’ round Three-Mile
Post, I fit with the Bump boys—three of ’em, brothers,
that lived down ’bout a mile outside o’ the Wall
over yender, onto the road to Paltz.</p>

<p>“Wal, they licked me—three of ’em, all bigger’n
me. They licked me bad. Course, I was crazy mad,
an’ I swore to Gawd I’d come down outen the Traps
some day an’ buckshoot ’em, an’ burn their house an’
I dunno what all. But there was four weeks more o’
pickin’, an’ the Bumps went somewheres else, an’ I
got cooled off, an’ by the time I got back here to the
Traps I’d made up my mind to leave ’em ’lone. An’
I did.</p>

<p>“Wal, it run ’long awhile, an’ huntin’ season come,
an’ then one night Snake Sanders got me full o’
licker an’ says we’ll go down b’low an’ git us some
coons—he knowed where we could git a passel of ’em.
I’d oughter knowed better’n to go anywheres with him,
but I was fool ’nough to go ’long, an’ he gimme more
licker, an’ we tromped an’ tromped, an’ I had more
licker, an’ so on. An’ then, fust thing I knowed, we
was nigh a house an’ barn, an’ our coon-dog warn’t
nowheres round, an’ I was gittin’ awful drunk. An’
Snake says, ‘Lay down awhile an’ ye’ll feel better.’
An’ I laid down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Then, next I knowed, my gun blew off—<i>bung
bung!</i>—an’ men was runnin’ an’ hosses screechin’ an’
the barn was all afire, a-blarin’ out all round so ’twas
light as day. An’ Snake was gone, an’ all to once I
see ’twas the Bump place that was afire, an’ somethin’
told me to git. So I run as fast as ever I could, never
takin’ my gun or nothin’. But bimeby I was way up
the road, an’ it was all dark, an’ I got tired an’ set
down to rest. An’ then the licker got a-holt o’ me an’
I went off to sleep.</p>

<p>“Wal, that was the end o’ me. They found me
a-layin’ into the road an’ they pounded me ’most to
death an’ drug me out an’ tried me for arson an’
’tempted murder an’ I dunno what all. I didn’t have
no more chance than a baby chipmunk into a hawk’s
nest. I couldn’t prove nothin’, and they wouldn’t
b’lieve nothin’, an’ they got proof o’ what I’d swore
to do to them Bumps, an’—they gimme the limit.</p>

<p>“An’ these three years I been doin’ time an’ gittin’
knocked round an’—oh Gawd! An’ Snake, he’s been
a-settin’ up here laffin’ at me an’ the Bumps—he was
ag’in ’em, I dunno what for, an’ he used me to git all
the blame for burnin’ up their place an’ their hosses
an’ pigs an’ shootin’ Charlie Bump—Charlie he got
buckshot into him an’ the hull place was burnt—an’
I got the limit—but I’ll git him—I’ll git him——”</p>

<p>He was growing incoherent, his eyes glazing with
concentrated hate and fury. Douglas thumped
him repeatedly on the shoulder and broke in on his
talk.</p>

<p>“All right, Steve, all right! Buck up, now! Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
turn’s coming—take a grip on yourself! Keep your
head until those bulls leave, and lie low.”</p>

<p>The youth gritted his teeth and swallowed hard.</p>

<p>“I’m a-layin’ low,” he asserted hoarsely. “I’m
a-keepin’ my head an’ my grip. I ain’t a-goin’ back to
no pen. But when oncet I git to a gun——”</p>

<p>He swallowed again and pawed with one lean hand
at his throat. Douglas nodded, his own face sombre.
Uncle Eb cleared his throat like a gunshot.</p>

<p>“I don’t hold with shootin’ yer enemies,” he erupted.
“I never yit shot at a man, an’ I don’t b’lieve into it.
Still an’ all, I dunno as I blame ye much. But ye got
to lay lower than ever now, an’ lay somewheres else.
Snake sent them fellers here—they as good as said so—an’
they’ll be back, I bet. Come dark, I’ll take ye
over into the rocks. I got some old clo’es an’ a hoss-blankit
ye can wrop up into, an’ I’ll send ye food right
’long reg’lar if Marry’ll take it—she’s spryer than I
be.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll be going now,” Douglas added. “I’m
keeping her waiting. She’s down the road, Steve—wouldn’t
walk with me. Take care of yourself—and
of her. So long.”</p>

<p>Before Steve or Uncle Eb could reply he was out
of the house. Across the road he went, pausing a
moment to beckon to the stubborn little red-haired
figure which now, walking very slowly, was approaching
from the curve. She made no answering signal,
gave no sign that she saw him. Climbing over the
stone wall beyond, he marched away across-lots, face
set stiffly toward the frowning wall of Dickie Barre
and the invisible Clove Road.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE MOVING FINGER WRITES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> by one the October days and nights stole in
from the nebulous realm of To-morrow and, like
pearls magically taking form on an enchanted thread
of gold, added themselves to the memory-gems of
Yesterday. Each morning found a new jewel vaguely
appearing out of the wan dawn-light; every passing
hour imperceptibly shaped the growing form; each
rising moon looked down on the completely rounded
treasure, nestling beside its mates which had come before.
No two were quite alike, for each was tinted
with its own delicate hues—the flush of a rosy sunrise,
the blue of the sky and the gray of the clouds,
the leaden tinge of rain, the sombre shadows of dusk,
the brilliant gleams of the stars. Yet no one of them
was all-sufficient; it was the blending, the intermingling,
of all of them that produced, or would produce,
the perfect circle.</p>

<p>And as the unseen hand of their Maker placed on
each its own peculiar tints, so the gentle fingers of
Mother Nature also worked unceasingly on the mantle
she had worn since the springtime, weaving into its
monotone new and ever-changing touches of color.
This was her play-day, this season between the summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and the snow; and with scarlet and crimson, with
yellow and cream, with the palest of green and the
rustiest brown, she transformed her emerald cloak
into a gay robe on which the dusky evergreens,
hitherto merged into the sweeping expanse of verdure,
now stood out bold and clear. Too, by night she
painted dingy house-roofs and rickety wagons and all
the other ugly man-made things—painted them gray-white
with frost, which the new sun quickly blackened
and sent creeping down the shingles to drip gently
from the eaves of a morning. And as that sun
mounted the Wall and rolled its warmth over into the
Traps below, she coyly loosed white clouds of mist to
go drifting along over the new colors she had made in
the dark hours, presently to draw them aside and reveal
to human eyes the glory of her handiwork.</p>

<p>Yet it was love’s labor lost, this wondrous wizardry
of hers—or almost lost. Of all the eyes which daily
opened in the Traps, few gave more than a casual
glance to all the enchantment wrought around them.
Most of those eyes turned inward upon the stomachs
of their owners, seeing only the “pannicakes” and
gravy, the “buttermilk pop” and other components of
breakfast; or they looked at pigs and hens and cows.
Few indeed were those who lifted up their thoughts
to the gorgeous hills surrounding them, and fewer still
those who, glimpsing what lay before them, were
moved to admire for even a passing minute. In the
flaming woods they visioned only animals and birds to
be killed, millstones to be rifted, hardwood to be
“mined” into charcoal, hoops to be shaved, and secret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
coverts where nameless industry might be carried on
in stealth.</p>

<p>But there were two in the Traps who saw. At their
doorways in the morning they looked long at the
limited sections of the panorama which were visible
from their respective abodes, noting the added touches
of color laid on during the silent hours of sleep.
Through the day, as they traversed the byways on
self-imposed missions, they paused often to gaze at
some striking bit of natural beauty near at hand or
to dwell upon the vistas opening out around them at
some higher point. In the twilight they sat somewhere
in silent solitude, watching the deepening of the dusk
and the shy appearance of the first night stars in the
darkening blue. These two were a blond-haired man
and a red-haired girl, who lived in little houses on the
road leading to the Clove.</p>

<p>Yet, though they looked on the same things, though
their souls were lifted up in the same way, though
they dwelt not far apart and their minds turned toward
each other many a time as the tinted days glided away,
they saw nothing of each other. The little bare feet
and the sturdy booted feet never turned into the same
path. They came and went, they paused and passed
on, they traveled open road and faint trail—but never
together. Between them stood a wall: a cold, stony,
stubborn wall which had suddenly thrust itself up out
of the ground as if conjured by the wand of an old-time
magician. And on that side of the wall facing
the man were graven words spoken by the girl:</p>

<p>“I don’t want to walk with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>On the other side—the side which the girl saw—the
wall bore other words: malicious words, evil words,
which yet had the ring of truth: words spoken not by
the man, but about the man, by others. And beside
those words burned a picture which made her writhe
and set her teeth into a red lip—a picture of herself
held unresisting in that man’s arms, beside the plashing
Coxing Kill. And atop that wall, leering down
at both of them alike, squatted the ugly little demon
who has wrecked many a life and will wreck many
more: Pride.</p>

<p>But for the presence of that malevolent imp, with
his taunting grin and his hissing repetition of the
rankling words, either of these two could have walked
straight through that wall. But there he perched by
day and by night, his claw-like fingers pointing ever
downward at the unfading words and picture, his
sneering grimace repelling them from taking the first
step toward each other. So, instead of moving toward
the barrier, each turned from it and traveled along it
or away from it—the girl traversing her own chosen
paths toward Dickie Barre, the home of Uncle Eb, the
upper reaches of Coxing Kill; the man roving along
the slopes of Mohonk, sitting for hours on the brink
of the Wall, or circling westward around the Clove
end of Dickie Barre and onward into the gorge of
cascading Peters Kill.</p>

<p>Still, though the little demon drove them to avoid
the spots where they were likely to meet, he could not
follow them and regulate their varying thoughts and
acts. His place was on that barrier, and on it he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
stayed. And thus he could not prevent the man from
mentally living over at intervals a certain golden hour
beside a deep green pool up above, nor keep from that
man’s eyes a gentle, far-away look when that memory
arose to keep him company. Neither could he block
the girl from returning repeatedly to that pool with
pencil and paper and crude sketching-board, nor close
her ears to the farewell words of the man:</p>

<p>“Keep right on doing that—it’s worth while—you’re
doing fine.”</p>

<p>So the pair traveled their separate ways. And,
traveling, Douglas noted that the new clothing of the
hardwood forests was not the only change taking
place round about him. Here and there in the woods
he met men. And, as subtly as the chill of frosty
morning gave way to the warmth of a sunny day, so
the first coolness of these men of the Traps now was
thawing into an intangible spirit of friendliness.
Where previously they had given him a cold stare and
curt replies or stony silence when addressed, now their
faces relaxed at sight of him, and of their own volition
they called: “H’are ye, Hammerless!”</p>

<p>Moreover, when he paused awhile to watch them
rounding millstones into shape or cutting cordwood
for charcoal, they betrayed no desire to have him
move on. On the contrary, they went ahead with
their toil as if he were one of their own neighbors,
welcome to stay as long as he liked. Sometimes, too,
they took a rest and smoked a pipe with him, saying
little of their own accord, but answering without hesitation
whenever he spoke. And when he moved along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
and left them, their “g’by” was as unobtrusively
cordial as their greeting.</p>

<p>As the days drifted by and his wandering feet bore
him into repeated contact with some of those men,
the conversations became still more easy and natural—though
never intimate. They talked of their work,
and he learned interesting things: that millstone cutters,
despite their hardy appearance and muscular development,
usually died fairly young because the stone-dust
entering the lungs caused tuberculosis; that charcoal-burning
meant much exposure to inclement
weather and constant vigilance, day and night, lest the
vents of the smoking mound become plugged and the
whole “mine” explode; that hoop-shaving, the main
industry of the region, was steadily falling off because
barrel-makers were adopting the “patent” hoops manufactured
by mills; that honey-hunting, though productive
of a passable revenue to the few whose instincts
led them to follow it up, was arduous, uncertain,
and often dangerous work because of the roughness
of the country, its unexpected pitfalls, and its
deadly snakes. And hunting and trapping, though
fairly remunerative if one happened to have a lucky
season, could hardly be considered a dependable source
of income.</p>

<p>These and other things of the same sort he learned
in the course of those recurring smoke-talks. He
heard, too, the same phrase repeated by different men
regarding their different industries—“a dog’s life.”
But he observed also that the men labored faithfully
on in that dog’s life, and more than once there recurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
to him Uncle Eb’s defense of his neighbors:
“Folks is mostly honest round here. Good, hard-workin’
fellers.”</p>

<p>The old man had spoken truth, it appeared. Though
a few worthless drones might exist here and there,
though more than one man might carry on surreptitious
business “up into the rawcks,” the Traps seemed
to be inhabited mainly by steady toilers, wringing a
primitive living from field and tree and stone and
berry-bush. Still, Douglas did not lose sight of the
fact that these workers did not compose the entire
population. Nor did he fail to observe that the conversation
of even those who seemed most friendly was
tinged by reticence.</p>

<p>Of their work, of hunting and trapping, of snakes
and catamounts and other life, of weather and crops—of
these things they would talk freely; but of one another
they would say no word. Let a name be mentioned—even
that of well-beloved Uncle Eb—and a
silence would follow. True, there were two names
which brought to their faces expressions as eloquent
as words: Snake Sanders and Nat Oaks. At the first
their eyes would narrow; at the second, their lips
would turn down in contempt. But no comment, good
or bad, was spoken of any one. It was borne in on
the wanderer that, though civilly received, he still was
not considered one of them; and that against all outsiders
these hillmen, whatever their private opinions
of one another, were a united clan.</p>

<p>In other little ways, too, this was shown. No man
ever asked him for tobacco or match. No man ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
quizzed him as to his past, present, or future. No
man betrayed friendly anxiety regarding his movements.
None offered to sell him milk or eggs, or invited
him to visit. Nor, though every one of them
looked wistfully now and then at his up-to-date gun,
did any one ask to be allowed to examine it—much
less to handle it. Between him and them, as between
him and Marion, stood an impalpable wall—though not
the same wall. This was the barrier of clannish reserve.</p>

<p>It was in this same clannishness, however, that he
found the key to their more friendly attitude. Though
not much given to analyzing the motives of others, he
naturally meditated on the change in their manner;
and the solution came in a name which he never mentioned
to them and which never was spoken in his
hearing—Steve.</p>

<p>Though nothing ever was said about the refugee, he
felt that the whole Traps clan knew Steve was here.
And, since the thaw in the previous frigidity of the
Trapsmen had come about since the afternoon when
he had hoisted the desperate youth to the roof and
badgered his pursuers into leaving the Wilham place
empty-handed, it was not hard to deduce that the hill-dwellers
also knew of what he had done that day. If
so, they must know that he was neither detective nor
criminal; for in the one case he would have worked
with the officers, while in the other he would hardly
have dared face them down. Therefore they now
must regard him as what he actually was: a transient
dweller here who had shown himself disposed to stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
with them in protecting their own, but who presently
would go back to his own world—and who, consequently,
need not be trusted with information concerning
any of them.</p>

<p>Very well: he could be as taciturn as any of them.
And he was. He gave no information regarding himself,
sought none about others—with one exception.
And to that one exception the reply also was an exception,
for it came readily, with a little grin of understanding.</p>

<p>“Heard anything of a couple of strangers?” was
his occasional question. To which came the prompt
response: “Hearn they was still round here.”</p>

<p>No man ever admitted that he had seen those
strangers, or vouchsafed any additional details of what
he had “hearn.” But with that answer Douglas was
content, for it showed that Ward and Bill had not run
down their prey. Of Uncle Eb he saw nothing, for he
spent little time at his own house and did not visit
that of the old man. He felt, however, that the refugee
was safely hidden somewhere among the ledges
and faithfully fed, that Eb could take care of Eb very
well, and that the less he himself knew about either
of them at present the better all around.</p>

<p>Of others who had entered his life recently he also
saw nothing in his daily rambles. Whatever Snake
Sanders and Nigger Nat Oaks might be doing, they
seemed to be avoiding his vicinity for the present.
Each evening on returning to his haunted house he
narrowly inspected both it and its clearing before entering,
and afterward he looked into every room before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
preparing his night meal. Invariably he found all as
he had left it. And when, healthily tired by his miles
of tramping, he sought early slumber, even the ghostly
Dalton’s Death failed to disturb him.</p>

<p>Not that the “ha’nt” was laid. It still walked about
overhead, still stole down-stairs on its heels, still
rustled the mattress of dead Jake Dalton and moved
his bedstead. Perhaps, in the silent watches of the
night, it did other things as well. If so, its restlessness
meant nothing to the new tenant, who slept the
sleep of a tired body and a clear conscience, awaking
only at long intervals to hear some unaccountable
sound and then, with a drowsy smile, drifting away
again into dreamland.</p>

<p>Much of his easy rest, however, may have been due
to the fact that he had changed beds. After the “line
storm” cleared up he had acted on his decision to
move out of reach of that too-convenient front window
and door. He had cleaned out the little room where
wood was piled, and on its floor he had built up a
quieter, more fragrant couch of his own: a foot-thick
layer of hemlock and spruce tips gleaned from the
trees behind the house. On this real camper’s bed he
now slept, leaving Dalton’s bedstead and noisy mattress
just as he had first found them. Each morning
before leaving the house, though, he carried his blankets
to that front bedroom and tossed them on the
corn-husks. Thus, if any one came spying in his absence,
the curtainless bedroom window would tell that
spy that he habitually slept where he was supposed to
sleep. A childishly simple ruse, perhaps, this was.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
Yet life or death sometimes hangs on the simplest
things.</p>

<p>And so, as has been said, the days brought their
lights and shadows, the nights their stars and dreams;
and within the ken of Hammerless Hampton nothing
at all happened. Yet, unseen, the fingers of Destiny
were steadily writing upon the pages of her future-book
certain records which no mere mortal now could
glimpse or guess.</p>

<p>Then, one lazy afternoon when he happened to be
at his bare little home, there recurred to him the tale
of Lou Brackett concerning the lost mine of the legendary
Ninety-Nine.</p>

<p>“Where the sun first strikes the wall in the morning,
there is Ninety-Nine’s Mine,” ran the saying which
the simple-minded woman had confided so mysteriously
to him. The “wall,” of course, was the cliff-line
within the Traps, not the great outer wall. Whimsically
he decided to sleep that night upon the eastern
heights and see just where the rising sun would strike
first. Sunrise on the Traps, viewed from that lofty
edge of things, would be a scene well worth a chilly
night outdoors.</p>

<p>With a pack of blankets and spare clothing and a
little food he started to go. But, with a boyish laugh,
he returned to the house. From some old burlap bags
and a few sticks of wood he made on Jake Dalton’s
bed a huddle which, in dim light, would resemble a
blanketed form. Then he departed, whistling merrily.</p>

<p>Dusk found him high up on the Wall. At the same
hour a form slipped out from the trees backing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
house of Dalton. It peered nervously in at a gloomy
window, stole along the side, slipped rapidly to the
front stoop, and, with a quick jab, slid a piece of paper
under the door. Then it jumped away and ran.</p>

<p>On the paper was written in scrawling characters:</p>

<p>“For gord Sakes dont Sleep hear to Nite.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A STAB IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rain</span> drizzled monotonously down on the Traps;
cold, raw rain swept slantwise by wind. Along Mohonk
and the Great Wall crawled clammy fog, blinding
all vision and chilling all flesh within its folds.
Through rain and fog feebly penetrated the sickly
light of a dismal dawn.</p>

<p>In the dankness and the dimness moved a bedraggled
figure laden with a sodden blanket-pack and a dripping
shotgun; a man whose blue lips and hollow eyes
betokened a gnawing chill and scant sleep. Downward
through dripping bushes he meandered uncertainly,
avoiding steep slants of smooth rock on which
his slippery boot-soles would inevitably precipitate him
into disaster, and peering continuously about in search
for a thin spot in the creeping cloud-bank. Only the
unmistakable slant of the mountainside told him which
way he was heading—back into the Traps gulf which
he had left on the previous day.</p>

<p>“A gorgeous sunrise—I guess so!” he grumbled.
“Mister Jupiter Pluvius, this is a dirty, low-down
trick. And Mister Ninety-Nine, you can keep your
mine till the crack of doom, for all I care. Go to
thunder, both of you! I’m cured.”</p>

<p>If the two old-timers whom he addressed were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
listening, they must have chortled in malicious mirth—especially
the former. Catching this mortal asleep
beside a dying fire, the rain-god had called up his
soggy servitors in the night and let them wreak their
will on the lone man—drowning his fire in the first
drenching assault and then battering him right merrily.
Without shelter, without light, he had been compelled
to huddle up and endure it until dawn; and even
now, though he was in motion once more, he had to
shut his teeth to keep them from chattering.</p>

<p>From side to side he wormed along his erratic way,
swinging from one ghostly bush-clump to another,
ever following the rambling line of safe footholds,
gradually descending toward the lower edge of the
enshrouding mist. After a time the bare rock ended
and he came into dense forest where the footing was
secure. Down through this he passed with swinging
strides. The rain ceased, and the wind died to a
breath. Faster and faster he pressed on, warmer now,
but eager to reach his house and dry out. Then suddenly
he slowed.</p>

<p>Dead ahead opened a cleared space, and beyond,
vague in the gray-white blur, were the faint outlines
of a rough shack. Scanning the place as he moved
on, he became sure that it was one which he had not
seen in his previous wanderings. The exterior of the
house was decidedly uninviting, but from its lopsided
chimney smoke was drifting thinly away into the fog.
His stride lengthened again. Since the inhabitants of
this house were up, he would stop there and ask for
some hot coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>But the quick decision was as quickly reversed.
As he neared the door it stealthily opened. Out stole
Lou Brackett.</p>

<p>“Morning,” he sang out, speeding up again.
“Lovely day.”</p>

<p>She started, turned her head, looked behind, advanced
with hand uplifted for silence. He paused.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud,” she implored as she reached
him. “Snake, he’s a-sleepin’, but ye might waken him
up. What ye want round here?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Just going home. Been up above and
got wet.” Smiling a little, he added: “I wanted to
see where the sun hit the wall first in the morning, but
it isn’t hitting to-day.”</p>

<p>Into the black eyes came a sudden light. She laid a
plump, not over-clean hand on his wet shoulder.</p>

<p>“Ye’re a-huntin’ the mine! I bet ye’ll find it, too,
if ye jest keep a-lookin’ long ’nough. Ye ain’t got
nawthin’ else to do—keep a-huntin’! An’ when ye
git to it ’member ye promised me some o’ the silver.
Will ye? An’ don’t tell nobody. Jest me an’ you—we
can git outen here together then.”</p>

<p>The broad hint brought a tart retort to his tongue,
but he swallowed it. Instead he asked: “So you still
want to leave? Why don’t you go, then?”</p>

<p>She stared as if he had lost his senses.</p>

<p>“Go wher’? Go how? I ain’t got no folks, mister—I
ain’t got no place to go—I ain’t got no money—I
ain’t got nawthin’. I ain’t never been nowheres—wha’d
I do outside o’ the Traps? An’ Snake, he’d kill me
sure’s shootin’, he would. ’Course, if I had some silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
or somethin’—but I ain’t got none. ’Less’n ye want to
take me out with ye——”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” he broke in bluntly. “But you can
get work in plenty of places outside where he never
would bother you.”</p>

<p>“I can’t!” she disputed, drawing back. “Them
that’s borned into the Traps lives into the Traps an’
dies into the Traps. Ther’ ain’t no place for us outside.”</p>

<p>“All right. That doesn’t match very well with what
you said about leaving, but never mind. How did you
and Snake make out that day about—er—the bridge?”</p>

<p>A slow smile spread across her face, revealing
anew the gap in her teeth.</p>

<p>“Oh, we got ’long all right—I done what ye told me.
He’d hearn ’bout it, but when he come at me I cracked
him good with the sadiron an’ jumped onto him ’bout
them Oakses. It kinder took the tuck outen him.
But”—her smile faded and her face turned hard—“that
red-head o’ Nat’s better leave my man ’lone!
Fust thing she knows I’ll—wal, she better look out,
tha’s all!”</p>

<p>“What’s that? Why, you’re crazy! She hates the
sight of him. Don’t you start any trouble with her, or
you’ll be mighty sorry. And what’s more, you can
tell your man that unless he lets her alone he’ll run
into something hard—the same thing that hit him on
Dickie Barre awhile ago. She belongs to——”</p>

<p>The next word on his tongue was “Steve,” with
more words to follow. But his habitual avoidance of
that name suddenly stopped his speech. She grinned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
sneeringly, interpreting his abrupt silence according to
her lights.</p>

<p>“She does, hey? Then ye better take her into yer
own house an’ watch her. Me an’ Snake don’t git
’long none too well, but no red-headed catamount like
her is a-goin’ to git him. He was down ther’ last
night late, I know he was—he never tells me nawthin’,
but I ain’t simple, an’ I know. He come back ’way
’long late, an’ he hadn’t been a-drinkin’, an’ if he ain’t
drinkin’ to Oaks’s what’s he a-doin’ ther’?
He’s——”</p>

<p>All at once she turned hurriedly, as if sensing something
in the house behind her. When she faced back
she looked perturbed.</p>

<p>“I got to git in. He might waken up any time.
G’by.”</p>

<p>“All right. But you mind what I told you!”</p>

<p>Without reply, she padded hastily doorward.
Frowning, he pushed away down-hill. The door
opened and softly closed, and the woman was gone.
The mist sifted around the man, and he too was gone.
And neither of them knew that Sanders, sleeping with
one ear open, had started up at the sound of the intruder’s
first careless greeting and since then had
watched snakily from the interior gloom.</p>

<p>He had heard nothing of what was said, for he was
in his bedroom, behind a shut door and a closed window;
and he had preferred to remain there, using his
eyes rather than his ears, making no move. Furthermore,
something about the appearance of that man in
the ghostly fog had seemed to paralyze him for a moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
when he first looked out. Then, recovering himself,
he had watched the colloquy with the eyes of evil,
interpreting it with the brain of evil. And now,
though again in bed and to all appearances asleep
when the woman Lou stealthily peeped in at him, he
was mentally gliding along a black, black path—like a
copperhead slithering through a sunless morass
wherein moved nameless things.</p>

<p>Onward down the slope marched Douglas, scowling
ahead at a well-marked path which his feet now were
following but which his mind hardly noticed. The
half-spoken threat of the woman behind against
Marion Oaks bothered him. Primitive, ignorant, unmoral,
willing to abandon her “man” for a better one
but jealous of any other woman who might attract
him—there was no knowing what she might do in some
vindictive rage. Douglas was not one of those men
who look on all women as children and scoff at their
dangerous moods; his newspaper experience had repeatedly
brought him into contact with stark tragedies
resulting from feminine jealousy; and he recalled the
Indian cheek-bones of Lou. Marion, he felt, should
be warned.</p>

<p>But he shrank from the thought of delivering that
warning himself. Not only was the rôle of tale-bearer
utterly repugnant to him, but that wall of Pride loomed
high and hard, as before. Moreover, the girl had repeatedly
shown that she wished her acquaintance with
him to remain unknown, had commanded him to remain
away from Nigger Nat’s house. What, then,
should he do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>The problem solved itself. The mist thinned, then
lifted a little, and he found himself nearing the road,
only a short distance above the Oaks place. And
when, striding along the road itself, he approached the
house of Nigger Nat, he saw both Marion and her
“mom” outside the door, apparently looking around
for some one. To his astonishment, Eliza Oaks hailed
him.</p>

<p>“Say! See anythin’ o’ my man anywheres?”</p>

<p>“Why, no. Lost him?” He turned into the yard.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Ye didn’t see him up the road nowheres?”</p>

<p>“Nope. But I haven’t been up the road very far.
Just came down across-lots.”</p>

<p>Her gaze went over him, taking in his thorough
wetness and the soggy blanket-pack. His eyes turned
to the girl, who had drawn back a little and was steadfastly
watching him. Over her thin dress she was
wearing a ragged old coat, evidently the property of
her father; and down the shoulders of the threadbare
garment, unconfined by the few pins which generally
held it up on her head, her hair cascaded in
rippling glory. Meeting his eyes, her own contracted
a little; but they held, unwavering. As swiftly as he
had decided what to do for Steve that day at Uncle
Eb’s, he determined what to do for her.</p>

<p>“Am I correct in assuming that this is Miss Marion
Oaks?” he asked formally, with the tiniest droop of
the off eyelid.</p>

<p>“You are,” she answered with a cold dignity matching
his own. “What of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>A subdued gurgle from the older woman drew his
gaze to her. On her shrewish lips he found a sour
smile.</p>

<p>“Ye needn’t to be so awful perlite,” she drawled.
“Marry told me ’bout what ye done to that ’ere catamount,
an’ how ye made them fellers leave her
’lone onto the road, an’ ’bout—wal, we’re ’bliged to
ye.”</p>

<p>“Good! Glad you know we’ve met before, I mean—there’s
no obligation. Er—how does Nat feel about
it?”</p>

<p>A scowl wiped off the thin smile. After a moment
of silence she answered guardedly: “He dunno
nawthin’ ’bout it.”</p>

<p>“I see. You don’t tell him all you know. Good
idea, maybe. He’s still sore at me, then. All right.
Just keep him away from me and we won’t have any
trouble. I’m sorry I had to shoot up those dogs of
yours, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’t’s all right. I was mad then, but we’re better
off ’thout ’em—they et more’n they was wuth. An’
mebbe ye done right to crack Nat when he come for
ye. He don’t mean no harm, Nat don’t, but he—he’s
kind o’ funny—he gits spells when he ain’t his own
self, like.” She looked worriedly around again. “I
wisht I knowed what’s ’come o’ him. He ain’t been
to home all night.”</p>

<p>Douglas eyed her, remembering what Lou had said—that
Snake had been here until late last night. But
then, feeling that the jealous woman might have been
utterly mistaken in her statement, he kept his thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
to himself. As for Nat, he probably was drunk somewhere.
He turned to Marion.</p>

<p>“Miss Marion, I’ve heard something which I think
you ought to know,” he plunged. “Er—well, a certain
woman up yonder thinks you and Snake Sanders
are too friendly to suit her. It’s absurd, of course,
but still—folks get queer ideas, and sometimes they
do queer things, and—maybe you’d better—er—keep
your eyes open——”</p>

<p>He floundered to a stop, reddening under the steady
gray gaze, in which he read mounting scorn. Humiliated
already by his position, he squirmed at her
drawling answer.</p>

<p>“So that’s where you’ve been to. Ain’t Snake to
home yet? You’re takin’ big chances, seems like. But
that ain’t anything to me. You needn’t worry for me,
Mister Hampton—I can take pretty good care of my
own self. But you can tell your friend, when you see
her the next time, if she’ll jest bust Snake’s head so
he won’t never come to, I’ll be much ’bliged.”</p>

<p>Before he could retort, her mother’s voice broke in.</p>

<p>“That ’ere Lou’s a bigger fool ’n Snake, ’n’ he’s
crazy ’nough. I ast him only yestiddy, says I, ‘Ye
mizzable idjit, how d’ye think ye’d ever git Marry
when ye got Lou already? I’ve told ye time an’ time
to keep outen here——’”</p>

<p>She checked herself suddenly, as if regretting her
outburst. The blond man’s eyes were on hers again,
boring like gimlets.</p>

<p>“So Snake was here last night,” he said. “And
where was Nat?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Nat—he was here—it warn’t last night—’twas in
the aft’noon. Then they went away, an’ Nat ain’t
back. I wisht I knowed——”</p>

<p>Once more she looked up and down the road.</p>

<p>“Snake’s at home,” he told her. “At least I was
told he was, when I came by his place just now.
Maybe Nat’s there with him. I don’t know. Well,
good-day.”</p>

<p>Without another look at the girl he swung about.
At his first step, however, Marion stopped him.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” she said. As he glanced at her he
found another change in her attitude. She still stood
with unconscious dignity, but the smouldering scorn
had died from her eyes, and her face had softened.</p>

<p>“I want to say thank you for what you done that
day onto the road—makin’ that detective feller let go
of me; and, more’n that, for helpin’ out—you know
who—up to Uncle Eb’s. And you meant all right by
tellin’ me jest now to look out, I shouldn’t wonder.
So I say thank you for that too. G’by.”</p>

<p>With that she was gone into the house. He opened
his mouth, shut it, glanced at Eliza Oaks, saw a faint
smile in her face, and laughed shortly. With a wave
of his free hand he started off again, and kept
going.</p>

<p>“What a wayward, fiery little thoroughbred!” he
thought. “Quick as a cat—now you see her mind
and now you don’t. She made one awful fool of you,
Hamp. Serves you right, too, confound you, with
your tattling! But she thanked you, at that, like the
real little lady she is. If she only had a chance to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
somebody—if it weren’t for the black blood—and
Steve—— Lordy, what a woman she’d make!”</p>

<p>The thought kept revolving in his mind until he entered
the fallow little field beside his bleak abode.
Then it fled.</p>

<p>His front door was open.</p>

<p>Instinctively he slowed. His searching scrutiny revealed
no other change in the house. Only that door,
which he had made to fit tightly by tacking on strips,
stood as if shoved back by a hurried entrance—or
departure.</p>

<p>“Wind?” he debated. “Wind blew last night, but
not hard. H’m! How come?”</p>

<p>Approaching guardedly, he peered within. Nobody
was there. Nothing seemed altered. The place not
only looked empty—it felt empty.</p>

<p>But before stepping over the threshold he shoved
the door hard with one foot. It swung back and struck
the wall, proving that nothing waited behind it. Entering,
he shot a glance into the bedroom where lay
the forgotten dummy of burlap. For a second he
stood rigid. Then he leaped into the room.</p>

<p>The dummy still lay there. But it had been visited
in the night. The visitor had left a memento of his
call. Its handle jutted horizontally from the huddled
sacks.</p>

<p>Douglas grasped that handle and drew upward.
From the burlap and the corn-husk mattress beneath
slid a long blade. Grimly he inspected it. When he
turned toward the outer room his face was flint.</p>

<p>He had seen that murderous tool before. It was
the corn-hook of Nigger Nat Oaks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>HUNTERS OF MEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Moving</span> rapidly about, Douglas inspected his real
bedroom and the spidery attic, finding his bough-tip
couch undisturbed and the upper room empty. Back
in the main room, he glowered anew at the bayonet-like
blade which had been driven with such venomous
force into what seemed to be a sleeping man.</p>

<p>“This cooks your goose, Nat Oaks!” he growled.
“You’ve let yourself in for the worst mauling you
ever got in your low-down life. Just as soon as you
and I meet up again—and we’ll meet just as quick as
I can find you!”</p>

<p>He strode to the door. But there he slowed, stayed
by the reflection that Nigger Nat was not likely to be
at home now and that he did not know where else to
look. “Better build a fire, eat, and dry out,” whispered
Common Sense. So he slammed the door shut
and returned to the cold stove.</p>

<p>With the kindlings in position, he reached to the
little shelf above him for a dry match—and knocked
the match-box to the floor. Stooping to pick up the
little igniters, he saw under the stove a scrap of paper.
Mechanically he lifted it, glanced at it, saw only a
blank space; folded it once, touched a match to it, and
held it under the grate to start the fire. It blazed out
bravely, the light of its own flame shining through it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he snatched it back and killed its blaze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
under a wet sole. The light had revealed writing inside
the little sheet.</p>

<p>Straightening out the charred, muddy remnant, he
read:</p>

<p>“—akes dont Sleep hear to Nite.”</p>

<p>Minutes passed while he squatted there, his whole
mind concentrated on that belated message. Then he
turned, inspected the floor, looked back at the stove,
and nodded.</p>

<p>“Somebody slid this under the door yesterday after
I left,” he deduced. “When the door opened later on,
the wind blew it here, wrong side up. Now who left
it? Not Lou Brackett—not Marry or her mother—they
don’t know a thing about this. Uncle Eb?
Steve? Not likely that they’d know what was to
happen. And it surely wasn’t either of those man-hunters.
H’m! Some one of these silent Trapsmen
who likes me, maybe. Well, my unknown friend, I’m
obliged to you. Call again some time.”</p>

<p>Again he studied the writing, the spelling, the paper—cheap
wrapping, wrinkled and soiled.</p>

<p>“You haven’t much education and you write like a
coal-heaver, but your heart’s true blue,” he added,
folding the blackened tatter and pocketing it. “I’d
surely like to know who you are. But if you’re as
close-mouthed as everybody else around here you’d
never admit that you wrote this, anyway. Well, let’s
start this fire.”</p>

<p>Soon a hot fire was roaring up-chimney, coffee was
coming to a boil, and he was arraying himself in the
few dry articles of clothing he could find, while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
wet garments and boots encircled the stove. After a
rough-and-ready breakfast he hugged the stove himself,
smoking and thinking.</p>

<p>Nat Oaks was a clumsy murderer indeed to leave
his weapon behind. Perhaps the ha’nt had scared him—the
open door indicated a sudden bolt from the
place. For that matter, it was strange that he had
ever dared to enter this house of fear at night. He
must have been full of “Dutch courage” at the time.</p>

<p>But there was Snake Sanders, too. Snake had been
with Nat when he left home yesterday afternoon. He
had returned to his own den late at night. And he
was a creature who always worked stealthily, snakily,
using others as his tools. In avenging his real or
fancied grudge against the Bumps he had used Steve
as his scapegoat. In trying to rid the neighborhood of
the “detective” and gain possession of the stranger’s
belongings he had employed a deadly reptile. Now
he and Nigger Nat had been much together of late—and
he had “some kind of a hold” on Nat. So Marion
had said. It was fair to suspect, then, that he had
been the instigator of this murderous attempt last
night. Yes, very fair. Almost a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>Yet there was no actual proof of Snake’s hand in
this. For that matter, the proof against Nat himself
was purely circumstantial. Another hand might have
wielded this corn-hook. It was even possible that the
corn-hook itself was not Nat’s, though it looked the
same. Corn-hooks probably were much alike. True,
this one had a whitish gouge on the handle near the
blade, and the same sort of mark had been noticeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
at the same spot when Nat had poised it for attack
that day in his yard. But still——</p>

<p>“First thing I’ll do, Nigger Nat, will be to find out
whether this hook is yours,” declared the man by the
stove. “If it is, the next thing is to get hold of you.
Then I’ll hammer the truth out of you.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this program, he stoked up the fire
and hastened the drying of the necessary articles of
outdoor gear. When at length his personal outfit
was again serviceable he went forth into the raw day.</p>

<p>But he did not start away at once. Memory persisted
in reminding him of Uncle Eb’s account of the
open door and of what he had found in the woods behind
the house. He rubbed his chin, then turned and
stalked toward those woods.</p>

<p>In under the funereal trees he passed, scrutinizing
the vague dark things here and there among the trunks,
finding them to be only rotting fragments of old logs,
half-buried juts of stone, or lumps of forest mould.
No sound came to him but the tiny impacts of falling
leaves and the watery squash of his own boots on the
soaked soil. Dreary and dismal stood the forest, telling
him nothing of what had taken place last night.
His only reward for his wandering there was a renewal
of his wetness.</p>

<p>Swinging back, he worked by the driest route toward
the road, thinking only of settling the matter of
the ownership of the corn-hook. And now that he
sought nothing, he found something: a grim reminder
of what had come about within these shades on another
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Under a hemlock was a sinister low mound. At one
end stood a short pine board. On the board he deciphered
scrawling letters shallowly cut with a jack-knife.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">JAKE<br />
DALTON</span></p>

<p>Though he had repeatedly visited these woods before,
seeking fuel, he never had stumbled on this spot.
Now he stood gazing thoughtfully down, hearing again
Uncle Eb’s words:</p>

<p>“What he was runnin’ away from—what had got
holt of him before he run—nobody knows. Nobody
but Jake, an’ he can’t tell.”</p>

<p>And last night another man had bolted from the
same house, from the same room—whither?—why?
Douglas felt a slight chill. With a sharp shake of the
shoulders he lifted his head and right-faced. Out to
the silent clearing he tramped, and straight up the
road.</p>

<p>On his way to the Oaks place he met nobody. The
only tracks not blurred by rain on the sand were his
own, made that morning. Entering the yard of Nigger
Nat, he slowed down, sharply scanning the windows.
No face showed there.</p>

<p>“Hey! Hullo!” he called.</p>

<p>After a pause the door opened. Marion’s head came
out.</p>

<p>“Hullo yourself! What you want? Seen pop anywheres?”</p>

<p>“No. He hasn’t come home yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“If he had I wouldn’t be askin’, would I?”</p>

<p>“Probably not. Well, I wonder if I can borrow his
corn-hook awhile.”</p>

<p>“Corn-hook? Why—yes, I guess so. He wouldn’t
like it much, but—— Mom, Mister Hampton wants
pop’s corn-hook awhile. All right? Wait a minute
and I’ll git it.”</p>

<p>She withdrew, leaving the door partly open. Presently
her voice floated to him from somewhere at the
rear.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t here! Mom, you been usin’ it? Well,
’tain’t here. What’s ’come of it, I wonder?”</p>

<p>Hammerless Hampton’s face tightened. To the door
he passed, drawing from under his coat the tool which,
despite its clumsiness, he had managed to conceal.</p>

<p>“Maybe this is it,” he called. Feet padded inside,
and both the girl and her mother appeared.</p>

<p>“Sakes alive! That’s it, now!” ejaculated the
woman. “It’s hisn—got the two nicks into the edge
that he never ground outen it, an’ there’s the place
where one o’ the dawgs bit onto it.” She pointed to
dull dents on the handle. “How come ye by it?” she
added suspiciously. “What ye askin’ for it for, when
ye got it already?”</p>

<p>“Just wanted to make sure it was his. I found it
down the road a piece—in some corn-husks.” He
watched her keenly. Her visage showed only blank
wonderment. The girl, too, looked mystified, but she
was probing his grim face with sharp eyes.</p>

<p>“An’—ye didn’t see nawthin’ o’ Nat?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing. But you can tell him, when he gets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
home, that I want to see him, and the best thing he can
do is to wait for me.”</p>

<p>Without another word or look he swung away, leaving
them staring after him in misgiving. On up the
road he journeyed, turning off at the path leading to
the lair of Snake Sanders.</p>

<p>The crawling mists had long since left the slopes,
and when he emerged again into the Sanders field the
shack was visible in all its raw nakedness. Smoke
still curled from its shiftless chimney, but the only
sign of life outside was a lonesome speckled hen
pecking disconsolately at the bare dirt. Watching the
windows, he marched up to the door and gave it a
resounding kick. Then he jumped to one side.</p>

<p>A chair fell over within, followed by hurried steps.</p>

<p>“Who’s ther’?” shrilled a sharp voice.</p>

<p>“Open up!” he snapped, warily sweeping the front
of the place, from corner to corner. “I want Snake!”</p>

<p>More steps. The door swung slowly back. Lou
Brackett’s face appeared, drawn into a squinting knot.</p>

<p>“Send Snake out here!” he commanded.</p>

<p>She eyed him, unspeaking, for a long minute.
Gradually her face relaxed. She came forward and
stood on the door-stone. Her right hand was gripping
a heavy flatiron.</p>

<p>“Snake, he ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“Where is he? I want him.”</p>

<p>“I dunno wher’ he’s at. He went out ’while ago—never
said one word to me after he got up, ’cept tellin’
me to git more cawffee. What’s pesterin’ ye? Wha’
for d’ye come a-kickin’ into the door——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Nat Oaks here?”</p>

<p>“Nat! No, mister, that yeller dawg ain’t! Him
nor none o’ his tribe—now or no other time! What
ye——”</p>

<p>“All right. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Leaving her open-mouthed, he circuited the house,
looking in at every window, finding that she spoke
truthfully: neither Sanders nor Oaks was there. She
still stood on the steps, gaping after him, when he
went back across the opening and disappeared down-hill
among the trees.</p>

<p>At the edge of the sandy road below, he paused,
undecided what to do next. Had he been in almost
any other place and seeking a man, he would have
visited other men and asked questions. But here in
the tight-mouthed Traps, what was the use? Still, he
felt a strong distaste for returning and idling out the
dismal day in his dreary abode. Half consciously he
turned toward Uncle Eb’s home.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up and smoke a pipe with the old man,
anyhow,” he decided aloud.</p>

<p>“Smoke it here if you want,” a voice answered.</p>

<p>The voice came from beside a tree not ten feet away.
Startled, he looked into the face of Ward, man-hunter.</p>

<p>“Caught you flat-footed, huh?” Ward went on.
“Bill’s behind you, if that’s what you’re lookin’ for.”</p>

<p>True enough, a few feet back from the other side of
the path, the morose face of Bill showed beside another
tree.</p>

<p>“Well! You fellows are getting good!” Douglas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
congratulated them. “Regular Indian stuff. You’d
have had me cold if you’d wanted me.”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Ward nodded carelessly. “But we don’t
want you—not yet.”</p>

<p>“Not yet? Meaning what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we ain’t got anything on you—yet. When we
do we’ll nail you. Right now we got other work.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! Mighty nice of you to tell me. How
are you making out?”</p>

<p>“Bum luck, so far,” was the frank admission. “But
we’ll git what we’re after. You could help us if you
would, but it’s no good askin’ you.”</p>

<p>Douglas grinned jauntily. Then he grew sober.
There was something about the patient, straightforward,
quiet-spoken Ward that appealed strongly to
him, just as there was a coarseness about “Brooklyn
Bill” that aroused his reckless antagonism. Too, he
himself was now a man-hunter on his own account.
With Bill silent behind him and Ward’s steady eyes
before him, he felt a sudden swerve from the Traps
current in which he had been drifting. Weighing his
words, he spoke out.</p>

<p>“See here, Ward. You haven’t told me who your
man is, and I’m not asking. Maybe I know something
about the case, maybe I don’t. But let’s suppose
a case.</p>

<p>“Suppose you’re looking for a fellow—only a young
lad—who got sent up for arson and a few other things
like that. Suppose I have reason to believe that the
young fellow never did what he was sent up for; that
he has served years for a crime he never committed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
that he was ‘framed.’ Would you blame me for not
wanting to help send him back to a good many more
years of the same?”</p>

<p>Ward’s eyes widened a trifle.</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t. I’d feel sorry for him myself.
But ‘framed’? How?”</p>

<p>“Used as a goat by an older man. Filled up with
liquor and left to take the blame for burning a house
and shooting people, while the man who really did it
sneaked back up here and laughed at you fellows.
That could easily be done.”</p>

<p>A pause, while Ward watched him steadily.</p>

<p>“Sure, it could be done. But to git the kid clear it
would have to be proved. Who’s the man?”</p>

<p>Douglas glanced behind him—up Snake Sanders’
road. The movement was involuntary, prompted by
an instinct to make sure that nobody else was lurking
and listening. But Ward’s shrewd eyes narrowed,
and he nodded as if in complete understanding.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying,” Douglas replied, facing him again.
“We’re just supposing, of course. But in that case,
you couldn’t expect much help from me, even if I
knew where the youngster was. As a matter of fact—if
you are looking for such a fellow—I don’t know
where he is. But, speaking of goats, here’s something
that’s not ‘supposing’ at all: While I was away last
night somebody entered my house and rammed a foot
and a half of cold steel into a dummy I’d left in my
bed. And I’m pretty sure that the mind back of that
stab—though maybe not the hand that did the stabbing—was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the same one that framed up that ‘supposed’
boy we’re talking about.”</p>

<p>Another pause.</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. And you’ve been up here to see about
it, and your man wasn’t home. Well, we’re waitin’
for that same gentleman; been wantin’ to see him for
quite awhile, but he’s a slippery cuss. When we do
git hold of him—we’ve got a few questions to ask him.
Glad you spoke that little piece of yours, Hampton.
We’ll keep it in mind.”</p>

<p>“All right. If I see him before you do he may get
mussed up considerably, so you’d better grab him soon.
So long.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Got any idea who swung that
steel on the dummy—if it wasn’t the same gent?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. But that’s my business. So long.”</p>

<p>“So long. Watch yourself.”</p>

<p>Douglas tramped away. Ward and Bill looked at
each other, slid back behind their trees, and resumed
their silent waiting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE SUN BREAKS THROUGH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> days of raw chill, leaden cloud, and numbing
wind rolled past. No more rain fell, but, except by
fitful gleams, no sun shone. Through each gray day
the dying leaves fluttered limply down, carpeting the
damp ground thicker and thicker with yellow and
crimson and brown. Through each black night a few
hardy survivors of the former myriad of katydids
quacked despairingly, and here and there a cricket
sounded a mournful call to comrades which no longer
answered him. Bleak November was drawing near.</p>

<p>In those gray days Hammerless Hampton ranged
the roads, the fields, and the forest, implacably hunting
the man or men who had struck in the dark at the lay
figure representing himself. Time and again he visited
the Oaks house and the Sanders shack. But never
did he find his quarry there. Time and again he was
asked, with suspicion verging on anger, why he kept
“a-pesterin’ round.” But he never told.</p>

<p>The manner of both Nigger Nat’s woman and Snake
Sanders’ woman became sullenly hostile. Yet, though
their attitude toward him was basically the same, there
was a difference. In the shrewish face and the snappish
answers of the former was revealed worriment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
for the missing man. In the lowering countenance and
the dogged replies of the latter was clumsy untruth.
The man who studied them both knew that Snake,
though always absent when he came, was present
at certain other times; while Nat had never come
home.</p>

<p>Of Marion he saw little. When he did see her it
was at her own door, and few words passed between
them. He knew, though, that her active brain was
surmising more or less accurately why he was hunting
her father, and in her sober face he saw grave concern.
But the rankling irritation of the other two
women was never visible in her voice or manner.
Whether her sympathies were with him or with her
own kin he did not know.</p>

<p>He did not confine his questioning, however, to these
three. Though he felt it to be useless—and, indeed,
found it so—to ask any of the clansmen for information
regarding the two whom he sought, he quizzed
every man he met. The only result was to cause keen
interest in his movements and to spread throughout
the mountain bowl the word that he was “a-huntin’
Nat an’ Snake with blood into his eye.”</p>

<p>Even Uncle Eb gave him no aid. But this time it
was not clannishness nor habitual taciturnity regarding
his neighbors that made fruitless the younger man’s
call on him. He really knew nothing of either of the
rascally pair.</p>

<p>“Nor I don’t want to,” he added bluntly. “If
ther’s anybody into the world I don’t want to know
nawthin’ ’bout, it’s them fellers. No, I take that back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
now I think onto it. Ther’s one thing I’d like awful
well to know ’bout ’em—that they was both dead. But
that’s too good to come true.”</p>

<p>The old man was standing in his doorway at the
time, and his manner was even more jerky than usual.
Douglas, outside, was conscious of the frank scrutiny
of two women at a near-by window—Uncle Eb’s wife
and spinster daughter, both intelligent-looking but decidedly
plain of feature. Uncle Eb, too, seemed
aware of listening ears, for he left his stoop and
walked to the road, out of hearing. He asked no
question, but his move was an obvious invitation to
tell why Nat and Snake were wanted. And, briefly,
Douglas did.</p>

<p>“The varmints!” Eb muttered fiercely. “The
murderin’ snakes! They’d oughter be shot! Only for
ye bein’ away they’d got ye. They’re a-layin’ low now
’cause they know ye’re a-trackin’ ’em. By mighty, boy,
ye must have a good angel a-watchin’ out for ye,
sendin’ ye out that day an’ all! Ye’d oughter change
yer bed now—mebbe change yer house too. I ain’t
soop’stitious, but ther’ ain’t no good luck into that
house o’ Jake’s.”</p>

<p>Douglas wavered, half minded to tell him of his
previous change in sleeping quarters and of the mysterious
missive of warning. But he held his tongue.
Such disclosures would do no good. Instead, he
shifted the subject.</p>

<p>“Maybe so, but I’m not moving out yet. By the
way, I saw those two detectives the other day. They
say they’ll get what they’re after.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Uncle Eb scowled. After a glance around he whispered:</p>

<p>“Son, I’m right worried. This is turrible weather
for that boy to lay up into the rocks. He ain’t tough
now—he was into the pen three year, ye know, an’
that weakens a feller—specially us hill fellers that’s
used to lots o’ air. I dasn’t bring him back down here—I
dasn’t go nigh him—for fear them detectives’ll
git to him; they been round here two-three times,
a-watchin’ an’ a-layin’ low. But I wisht he could git
under cover some’rs. I hear he’s got a misery onto
his chest already.”</p>

<p>The younger man frowned in concern. Comfortably
clad though he was, he felt the raw bite of the
air; his ungloved fingers, in fact, were partly numbed.
And Steve, cowering among those clammy bowlders,
unable to risk a fire—why, the boy was barefoot!</p>

<p>“D’ye s’pose, now, ye could toll them fellers out o’
the Traps for good?” Eb suggested hopefully. “Ye
fooled ’em deef, dumb an’ blind that time they was
right onto his back. Mebbe ye could——”</p>

<p>He paused. Douglas reluctantly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Afraid not. They know now that I’m on Steve’s
side. It wouldn’t work. But—I’ll see if I can think
of something.”</p>

<p>Dubious as the answer was, Eb’s face showed some
relief.</p>

<p>“Do that, son! Think o’ sumpthin’—anythin’—an’
then go do it. I been a-thinkin’ till I’m all jumpy like,
an’ it don’t git me nowheres. Mebbe I’d oughter let
him shift for himself, seein’ he ain’t no relation o’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
mine, but I can’t keep my mind offen the boy. He
was borned unlucky, ye might say, an’ he never had
much of a chance, an’—I’m right sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“Born unlucky? How do you mean?”</p>

<p>Uncle Eb glanced sidewise at him; pulled at one end
of his walrus mustache; spat loudly, looked at his
windows, and spoke—but did not answer.</p>

<p>“I got to be gittin’ in. I’m a-gittin’ cold. Uh—do
what ye can for the pore feller. G’by.”</p>

<p>Hastily he lumbered houseward. Douglas stared,
laughed shortly at the awkward rebuff, and sauntered
away, unoffended. He knew the old man’s tongue had
been clutched by the hand of habit—the habit of telling
no tales about others; and, in a way, he honored
the old fellow for it. What mattered Steve’s birth,
anyway? The real crux was the problem of his immediate
future.</p>

<p>All the way back to his abiding-place that problem
bothered him. Night was not far off now, and the
cold was increasing. Looking up at the chill gray
cliffs of Dickie Barre as he passed along the road, he
shivered. What a cheerless refuge for a half-clad
boy! Skulking there alone in a black hole night after
night, numbly waiting day after day, subsisting on
cold food smuggled to him by stealth, dreading every
sound, with a growing “misery onto his chest”—he
was in a worse prison than the one from which he had
escaped. Beside him, its grisly fingers perhaps already
touching his lungs, lurked the dread spectre of the
hills—Pneumonia. And he, Hampton, though he lived
in a haunted house, had shelter and stove and warmth—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
more room than he needed. All at once he
nodded sharply. He knew what he would do.</p>

<p>Before night set in he worked a little while at his
back door, which opened hard and creaked loudly.
With his camp-ax he trimmed its edges, and with gun-oil
he lubricated the rusty hinges, until it could swing
easily and silently. After barring it he turned to the
window of his sleeping-room, which hitherto had been
wedged so that it would admit fresh air but nothing
else. On this also he labored for a time. When it
would rise with smooth speed he locked it with a short
stake and turned his attention to preparing supper.</p>

<p>“Maybe to-morrow night we’ll have company,” he
informed the emptiness. “Maybe.”</p>

<p>An hour later he was asleep on his aromatic couch,
and the whole house was given up to darkness and
silence.</p>

<p>As the black hours wore on, the boards above his
head dully gave notice that the ha’nt was prowling
back and forth on its softly thumping bare heels.
Perhaps his subconscious self knew of the movement,
but it did not arouse his sleeping senses—it was only
the usual nightly occurrence. Out in the main room
beyond his closed door, too, something moved about:
a silent, hideous, unhuman thing which paused awhile
beside the wooden barrier, then glided elsewhere; a
thing which opened no doors or windows, which
neither entered the house nor left it, but which presently
was gone. Of this, too, he knew nothing. The
weird sough of the sepulchral pines behind the house,
the proximity of the mound holding all that was left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
of the man who had been done to death here, the steel-slashed
rent in the corn-husk mattress beyond the wall—none
of these things troubled him. Tranquilly he
slept until morning light smote softly on his lids and
woke him to a new day.</p>

<p>Sun and warmth flooded the Traps when, after
breakfast, he emerged into the open. After the grayness
and the numbness of the past few days, the change
was magical. But for the thinly clad branches above
and the sodden wind-blown leaves below, it would have
seemed mid-August instead of late October. In the
hot air flies buzzed, bees hummed, and a resounding
chorus throbbed from crickets and katydids defiantly
informing the world that they were not yet dead. And
from all sides drifted the damp fragrance of forest
mould and of grass-ground drying in the heat.</p>

<p>But, as a wandering breeze floated from the region
of a bush-bound little brook beyond the road, it
bore into the pleasant aroma of plant life a vague
taint.</p>

<p>Douglas, inhaling the freshness of the morning, half
sensed that slight odor and glanced around. But then
the breeze died and he forgot it. Drawing another
great lungful of air, he struck off up the road toward
the Oaks place.</p>

<p>Before he reached it the sound of chopping came to
him. As he entered the yard he found a figure slugging
away at a chopping-block with an ax which
seemed dull. It wore a man’s hat, but it also wore a
dress. The hat fell off as he approached, and the sun
glowed red in the tumbled hair suddenly revealed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
At the sound of his step the girl wheeled sharply and,
panting and flushed, looked at him.</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t home,” she said before he could
speak. “You can run right ’long up to Lou’s.”</p>

<p>She turned from him, picked up another stick of
fire-wood, swung the ax dexterously, and split the
fagot clean. Something about her words and manner
gave him a sudden glimpse of her side of that pride-wall
which had stood between them: the side which
he had supposed to bear the face of Steve, but which
now seemed to hold something else. He stepped forward
and closed one hand over the ax-helve.</p>

<p>“Look here, Marion,” he said quietly, “I don’t like
that.”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t much to me what you like,” she retorted,
though with little heat. “Jest travel ’long.”</p>

<p>“When I’m ready.” He kept his grip on the handle.
“But let’s settle this now. You’ve been acting offish
for quite awhile—ever since the day we talked about
art and—and so on, up the brook. I’ve been too bull-headed
to ask you why. But I’m asking you now,
straight and square; and asking you, too, why you
keep intimating that Lou is a particular friend of mine.
Now speak up, man to man.”</p>

<p>With steady directness she looked up at him. Wide
gray eye and clear blue eye searched each other to the
depths. And then, man to man, straight from the
shoulder, she spoke out.</p>

<p>“I heard ’bout you huggin’ her under the bridge.
’Tain’t any of my business, only——”</p>

<p>“What’s that? <i>Hugging?</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Yes, sir, huggin’. And pretty hard, too. And
that wasn’t much more’n an hour after—after”—she
flushed crimson—“after you—made me—fight to git
my picture. The only difference it makes to me is
this: you couldn’t have much respect for yourself to
do it, or for me either. ’Course, I’m only Nigger
Nat’s girl, and folks ain’t got much respect for him or
anybody of his, but—but that’s different.”</p>

<p>“I should think so!” he agreed crisply. “Those
dirty little gossips who spied us made a fine tale of it,
didn’t they! Well, now, here’s the exact truth.”</p>

<p>And the exact truth of that incident he gave her.
He omitted only to tell of the woman’s clumsy attempt
to lure him and of her appeal for silver from
the lost mine; and these parts he left out only because
of innate chivalry toward even such drab womanhood
as Lou’s.</p>

<p>“So that’s all there is to it,” he concluded. “I
tried to help her out but only got her into a worse
mess, thanks to lying tongues. Now you can believe
me or those kids, just as you like.”</p>

<p>A little longer the gray eyes held his. Then they
fell, and on her lips dawned the first smile he had seen
there in many a long day.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m glad you come visitin’ this mornin’, even
if you are mad at my pop,” she said softly. “But
have we both got to keep holdin’ this ax?”</p>

<p>“No,” he smiled. “I can hold it alone. Let go.”
She obeyed.</p>

<p>“Now I didn’t come hunting your pop to-day,” he
went on, “although I’m on the lookout for him all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
time, and—— Tell me, do you care much about your
pop?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s the onliest pop I’ve got,” she naively
reminded him. “But I don’t care much about him.
He’s awful ornery.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. He’s all of that. But we’ll forget
him for now. I came over to-day to ask you to take
me to—a friend of ours.” She looked up quickly.
“Uncle Eb tells me he’s sick, and I want to see him.
Will you guide me?”</p>

<p>Dubiously she looked all about. Her whispered
reply was hardly audible.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go careful. The detective fellers,
they’re a-watchin’ all round—mebbe they’re up into
some of these trees right now. But—can you help
him some way?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’ll go. Cut me a little more wood
while I take this into the house. Mom, she’s abed yet;
she don’t feel good this mornin’. But she ain’t real
sick. We’ll go pretty quick.”</p>

<p>With another smile at him she gathered up wood
and hastened in. And Hammerless Hampton set his
gun against the wall and looked around, marveling at
the brightness of the sun and the sweetness of the air
and the cheeriness of the birds. Even the harsh cries
of the bluejays in the woods sounded musical. In all
the Traps at that moment he could perceive not one
discordant note of sound or color. Indeed, something
disagreeable seemed magically to have vanished from
the world, and it was good to be alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>And something had vanished: something nebulous,
intangible, yet real and rock-hard: the two-sided wall
of Pride. And Douglas, feeling that all was well with
the universe, began lustily swinging the ax in the
service of the girl who was glad he had come visiting.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>LIBERTY OR DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> a dim, winding trail, through baffling undergrowth
and around half-buried blocks of stone and
over prostrate tree-trunks, a man and a maid passed
in silence. Under foot the damp leaves, not yet dried
by sun or wind, gave out no betraying crackle. The
pair spoke no word, made hardly a rustle as they
touched bare stems or twigs. They seemed bound on
an all-day hunting trip, for the man carried a shotgun,
and the girl a little apron knotted into a bag, containing
food. Yet it was the girl who led the way.</p>

<p>Upward, ever upward they climbed on a slope whose
pitch grew more and more steep. At length they
paused at the edge of a gigantic mass of bowlders,
above which towered stark crags split by a yard-wide
fissure.</p>

<p>“We go up into that crack, then ’long the top of the
ledge to the left, then down again,” Marion breathed.</p>

<p>“Why?” he remonstrated. “Why not work along
here without going up and down?”</p>

<p>“You ain’t much of a detective if you can’t guess
that,” she laughed. “Up on top we can watch back
and see if we’re follered. Down here we can’t.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” he conceded. “You’re a better
dodger than I am. A better climber, too, probably.
These boots don’t grip bare rock very well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Go ’long, and go slow. Don’t bump and scrape.
We’ve got all day.”</p>

<p>After surveying the jumble above, he began working
up into it, moving with caution but with creditable
speed. For a time he was so engrossed with the toil
of quietly moving himself, his damp-soled boots, and
his gun, that he gave no attention to her. When at
length he paused at the foot of the fissure he looked
back—and found her close at his heels.</p>

<p>“You’re awful slow and stiff,” she taunted, as if
she had not just warned him to proceed cautiously.
“I’ll go ’long up and wait. G’by.”</p>

<p>And up she went with a flash of tanned ankles and
a swirl of swaying skirt, her toes gripping with unerring
surety at the soil slanting down within the
crevice, her lithe young body swinging with easy
grace, her hair flaming like an upshooting meteor.
At the top she swung and laughed once more with the
exhilaration of strenuous activity. Then she moved
from sight.</p>

<p>“Whew!” breathed Douglas, contemplating the
slope. “Our catamount can climb! Imagine a
corseted, high-heeled city girl doing that. Imagine me
doing that! If I don’t come flopping back down here
end-over-end I’ll be lucky. Well, here goes.”</p>

<p>Digging in his toes, he started. For a few feet all
went well. Then his soles began to slip, and only a
clutch with his free hand stopped his slide. By the
time he was half-way up he was clambering crabwise,
forcing in his heels. And when he neared the top he
was using every support he had—feet, hands, and gun-butt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
However, he made the ascent without a fall;
and, thanks to his recent days of roving, without much
loss of wind.</p>

<p>Marion had disappeared, but the little bundle of
food lay beside the cleft. Presently she came creeping
back on hands and knees from the outer brink and
stood erect.</p>

<p>“Well, Mister Slowpoke, you got here before noon
after all,” she gibed. “I ’most went to sleep waitin’,
the sun’s so hot out yender. There ain’t any detectives
into sight, so when you git rested we can travel ’long.”</p>

<p>“Rested? I’m not so feeble as you think,” he
smiled. “And just remember that I have to lift about
seventy or eighty more pounds of bone and meat at
every step than you do. You’re only a flyweight. Bet
I can lift you with one arm.”</p>

<p>“Bet you can’t!” she flashed.</p>

<p>Forthwith he laid down his gun and swept her off
her feet. Steadying her with the right hand lightly
laid against her shoulders, he raised her on his rigid
left forearm. She wriggled, slipped, and instinctively
seized him around the neck. Both his arms suddenly
tightened around her. Her face came close to his.</p>

<p>The next instant a firm little hand set itself against
his chin. Though his grip still held her, her face now
was more than a foot away. The slender arm between
them was like a steel bar.</p>

<p>“Let go!” she commanded.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Afraid I’ll kiss you?” His
eyes were dancing recklessly. “Or are you afraid I
won’t?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Afraid—you—won’t? That’s ’bout ’nough! You
ain’t under a bridge now!”</p>

<p>The twit stung. His face darkened. He set her
down abruptly, picked up his gun, moved away toward
the left.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t mean that,” she quickly added. “I
dunno why I said it—it jest come, like. But—remember,
we come up here to see somebody.”</p>

<p>He nodded sombrely and strode on. Confound it!
Why did these hill girls take things so seriously? He
hadn’t meant to kiss her anyhow. Or had he? He
didn’t know; maybe, in that momentary devil-may-care
mood, he would have done it. And what if he
had? There was nothing fatal about a careless kiss
or so, all in fun. But then, there was Steve, of course.
Yes, that was it. That fierce, vengeful, desperate boy—she
was cleaving to him, one of her own people,
and the kiss of any other man was not to be lightly
taken. So be it. She was right enough, of course.</p>

<p>Yet, in his unintrospective way, he felt a vague
irritation over the eternal presence of Steve. If only
the youth did not exist—— He let the thought go no
farther. He did not consider what might be if Steve
were removed. Neither did he recall that this girl’s
blood was tainted by her parentage. He let the whole
matter die, and instead put his mind on the lonely,
sick boy himself, victim of Snake Sanders’ machinations
and fugitive from the insensate monster which
killed men’s souls—the Law. Sympathy for him again
warmed his heart. He pressed on in his errand of
aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“D’you shave every day?” sounded a small voice
at his heels.</p>

<p>“Uh? Shave?” He groped, bewildered by the
sudden change of thought. “Why—yes. Every
morning after breakfast. Why?”</p>

<p>“Your chin’s so smooth. It ain’t all full of splinters
like pop’s. And your face always looks so clean. I
never see any other man that kept his face clean every
day. I—I kind of like it.”</p>

<p>The ingenuous statement made him laugh.</p>

<p>“Glad there’s something about me that you like,” he
mocked. “But to me it’s not so much a matter of
appearance as of comfort. I can’t stand a mess of
bristles on my face and throat. It’s prickly. So I
slice it off.”</p>

<p>They trudged on, following a faintly defined path
well back from the brink, invisible to any eye which
might look up from below. After awhile she said
softly, as if talking to herself: “Steve’s gittin’ awful
whiskers onto his face.”</p>

<p>Remembering the bristly black beard he had noticed
on the fugitive’s unshaven face at their last meeting,
he nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>“Of course. How can he shave?” he reminded
her. “But maybe he can clean it off soon. We’ll
see.”</p>

<p>“What you figgerin’ to do?”</p>

<p>“Ask him to come down and hide in my house,
where he’ll be dry and warm.”</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp.</p>

<p>“Why—why, he can’t! With them detectives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
pesterin’ round—if they should come he’d be caught
into a reg’lar trap. And you’d git ’rested too.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. But it’s getting too cold for him to lie
up here. To-day’s hot, but to-morrow—— He’s got
to move somewhere soon.”</p>

<p>Soberly she studied him.</p>

<p>“That’s so, but he won’t come, I don’t b’lieve. I
tried to git him to come down and stay to our house,
but he wouldn’t. He dasn’t trust pop. And them detectives,
they watch everywheres. They come there
one time and asked pop a lot of questions. I dunno
what they asked him—I wasn’t round; but pop’s apt
to say ’most anything or do ’most anything—depends
on how drunk he is.”</p>

<p>“Steve’s wise not to go there, then. But it’s different
at my place.”</p>

<p>No more was said. Marion looked often at him as
they journeyed on, and her face was troubled. He
kept his forward-ranging gaze on the vague path.</p>

<p>After a time he found himself emerging at the
brink. Here she resumed the lead. Down over a
jagged confusion of leaning bowlders she picked a
tortuous way, followed by the more slowly moving
man. Presently they were under the cliff, amid thick
brush, on steep but firm-soiled ground whence protruded
a few deep-sunk blocks. She moved a rod or
two to the left and paused.</p>

<p>“See anything?” she questioned.</p>

<p>He studied the surroundings and shook his head. In
the blank face of the precipice showed no opening—not
even a crack. The cliff, the ground, the brush,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
the half dozen juts of gray stone—there was no sign
of a hiding-place. True, there were two fair-sized
bowlder-tops close together, with a small black hole
between; but the hole must be only a cranny in the
earth, like hundreds of others along the wall—a good
place to break a leg, but not to hide in. He did not
give it a second glance.</p>

<p>Yet it was at this despised hole that she knelt. Into
it her head vanished, and from it sounded her signal—a
soft “Hoo-hoo” almost inaudible above ground.
From somewhere down in the bowels of the tightly
packed earth floated a faint sound in reply. Her head
reappeared.</p>

<p>“I’ll go down first to tell him it’s all right,” she
murmured. “You wait ’bout two minutes or so, then
come ’long. It’ll be tight squeezin’—you’re so wide
acrost the shoulders—but you can git through.”</p>

<p>She pushed the apron-package into the hole. Then
she turned once more to him.</p>

<p>“This here is my little secret, that I’ve come to for
years,” she told him. “There ain’t anybody ever been
into it but me—and Steve. The place Uncle Eb took
Steve to wasn’t so good—it was too easy to find—so
I brought him here.”</p>

<p>With that she was gone into the gloomy opening.</p>

<p>For a minute or two he waited, looking at the hole
and picturing to himself a lonely, heart-sick little girl
coming here year after year to forget the drunken
coarseness of her father and the profane nagging of
her mother. A disappointing place, this prosaic cavity;
not at all the picturesque grotto his fancy had painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
when, in idle moments, his mind had reverted to her
confession of a “playhouse” where she took refuge
by her “own self.” Yet somewhere within it must be
a real cavern among the sunken rocks, where, forgetful
of the raw crudity of her life, she had lain many
a time gazing star-eyed at the figments of her dreams.
Did she ever, he wondered, dream of a Prince Charming
who should bear her over the hills and far away
into a world of lights and laughter, music and perfume?</p>

<p>Perhaps her untutored imagination could not even
vision such a world. Perhaps her soul, like her body,
was hemmed in by the eternal rim of the rock bowl—that
soul which yet groped vaguely upward with its
unconscious artistry, its vision of dead men who shook
the hills with their tramping, its effort to place on
paper the beauty of the green pool in Coxing Kill.
Perhaps Lou Brackett’s dictum was inexorably true:
<i>Them that’s borned into the Traps lives into the Traps
and dies into the Traps</i>.</p>

<p>Recalling himself, he dropped to his knees, dubiously
sized up the passage, sank prone, and began
worming his way inward.</p>

<p>Once inside, he found that it was not so black as it
had looked. Somewhere ahead, light came faintly up
from a lower level. The tunnel slanted at an easy
grade and curved a little to the right. For the first
few feet he found her surmise correct—it was a tight
passage for him. But, after inching along in growing
distaste for the squeezing discomfort of the hole, he
found the rock walls veering aside and lifting above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
him. A few feet more, and he had room to rise to all
fours. The dim light grew a shade stronger. He
found his face hanging over a drop, below which was
a steep, curving chute.</p>

<p>Swinging his feet foremost, he went over and down,
sliding a little but holding himself by hand-grips along
the wall. He stopped on the level lip of another
drop.</p>

<p>Before him widened an oblong cavern, fairly well
lighted by rifts in the stony walls and by another entrance
at its farther end—a sizable hole at the floor-level,
evidently leading downward. It looked quite
dry, except for a tiny trickle of water down one side;
its floor was well carpeted with leaves, obviously
brought in from above; and in the walls were irregular
natural shelves, most of which held small
treasures of childhood—a cracked cup or two, worn-out
cooking utensils—such things as a little girl might
have brought there to make it a real “playhouse.”
And some six feet away was the little girl herself—Marion—with
her wild Steve.</p>

<p>“H’are ye, Hamp,” the youth hoarsely greeted him—and
clutched at his chest. For a second or two he
set his teeth; then, throwing one sleeve across his
mouth to muffle the sound, coughed repeatedly. When
he lowered the arm his lips were drawn. Dumbly he
rubbed his chest.</p>

<p>“Howdy, partner,” Douglas returned, surveying
him keenly and noting his haggard face and hollow
eyes. “Sore inside?”</p>

<p>“Got cold,” nodded Steve. “Can’t stop this ’ere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
cough a-rackin’. Can’t sleep good. An’ ther’s a
misery onto my left lung. Lot o’ pains like red-hot
needles. Got to breathe short. Cough nigh rips the
lung outen me. Makes too much noise too. If them
dicks hearn it——”</p>

<p>He spoke in short whispers, his hand rubbing
mechanically, as if it had done the same thing at frequent
intervals for many hours. The man above regarded
him gravely. Though strong of lung himself,
he knew what pleurisy was; knew, too, that there was
such a thing as pleuropneumonia. The lad below
looked to be rapidly heading into something of the
kind. He certainly was not the healthy young fellow
he had been that day in Uncle Eb’s barn.</p>

<p>“Head ache? Feel hot?” Douglas quizzed.</p>

<p>“Yuh. Head’s like to split. I’m hot all over, like.”</p>

<p>Another strangled cough, with its after-grimace of
pain. Douglas looked below, found a couple of shelves
forming natural steps, and descended. He laid a hand
on Steve’s forehead. The hot skin seemed to burn
him.</p>

<p>“H’m! I was afraid so,” he muttered. “Fever,
headache, pleural pains, cough. H’m! Well, Steve,
now listen. You’re sick. If you stay here you’ll be
sicker. Now my place is sort of lonesome, and nobody
calls on me; and the woods are right handy to
the back door, so you could make a quick getaway if
you had to; and it’s dry and——”</p>

<p>A determined shake of the head cut short his preamble.</p>

<p>“Marry told me,” the lad refused. “I ain’t a-goin’.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Mebbe I’m sick. Mebbe I’ll die. But it’s all right.
I’ll die by inches ’fore I’ll go wher’ I’ll git caught.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool! What’s the good of——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say no more. I ain’t a-goin’. Ther’s things
wuss’n me dyin’. Goin’ back to the pen’s one. Gittin’
my friends into trouble’s ’nother. I ain’t got but three
friends into the world. Marry an’ you an’ Uncle Eb.
I come awful nigh gittin’ two o’ ye into a mess t’other
day. Them dicks’d make ye sweat blood if they
knowed ye was a-helpin’ me. An’ I don’t danger ye
no more.”</p>

<p>He writhed with another cough. Amazed by the
unexpected chivalry of the hill boy, Douglas stood
dumb. Presently Steve went on with the same pain-clipped
sentences.</p>

<p>“’Sides, I can’t live into a house. Marry’ll tell ye
that. I warn’t borned into a house. I was dropped
into the woods like—like a wolf-pup. I can die like
that same wolf: into the rocks or the trees. I ain’t
a-dyin’ yet, anyways. An’ till I do die——</p>

<p>“I went to school a little. Not much. Couldn’t
stand it ’less’n the winders was open. But I learnt
readin’. I see a piece ’bout a feller that said ‘Gimme
liberty or gimme death.’ That’s me. I live free—if
it’s into a hole. Mebbe I die into the same hole. But
I die free—not like a rat into a house-wall. Gimme
liberty or——”</p>

<p>A tearing spasm of muffled coughing ended his talk.
When it had passed he slumped down against the side
of the cavern, his brow knotted in agony, his hand
rubbing feebly, but his gaunt jaw set like the rock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
against which he leaned. And Douglas, after a moment
more of grave study, gave him up. He was not
to have company in his haunted house after all. His
toil last night on the rear door and the bedroom window
had come to naught.</p>

<p>Yet the time was to come when, despite the flat
refusal of the fugitive to leave his den, that smooth-sliding
back window in Hampton’s home was to serve
Steve well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE HAND OF THE GHOST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas</span> pushed off his hat and ran a hand through
his hair, puzzling over what to do now. Despite
Marion’s prediction, he had not seriously considered
the possibility of an inflexible rejection of his offer,
and now he was somewhat at a loss.</p>

<p>Squatting beside Steve, he absently dug up his
empty pipe and puffed at it, thinking. Steve looked
wistful, but said nothing. Marion, sitting on a little
leaf-cushioned projection of stone, watched both of
them unobserved.</p>

<p>The contrast between the two male faces was striking.
Douglas, blond, strong, clean of skin and clear-cut
of feature, thoughtfully serious, working out the
problem of helping another: Steve, swarthy, wan,
black-bristled, unkempt, grim-jawed, determined to
follow his own course despite reason and sense; truly,
they seemed as opposite as light and darkness, as blithe
hope and sombre desperation. Yet the dark face, perhaps,
would strike more forcefully on vibrant heart-strings;
for mingled with its resolution was an unconscious
pathos. To a sympathetic eye, too, the
ragged, shapeless clothing of the younger man would
have appealed more strongly than the well-fitting garb
of the other. But Marion was not looking at the dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
of the pair. Silently, steadfastly, here in her dream-cavern
she was studying faces—and men.</p>

<p>“Well,” Douglas said slowly, removing his pipe—and
stopped. He saw the hollow eyes, eloquent with
tobacco-hunger, follow the motion of the blackened
briar. Wiping its stem on a sleeve, he passed it over.
Steve grabbed it and began eagerly sucking in the
strong incense of bygone smokes. The little touch of
comradeship was not lost on the girl, nor was the next
movement of the blond man. He produced a tobacco-tin,
picked out a third of its contents, and handed the
rest to Steve.</p>

<p>“Better not smoke it,” he suggested. “The smoke
will float outside. Chew it. I’ll have Uncle Eb get
more for both of us. Now I won’t argue with you
about moving. You say you won’t, and that ends it.
But you’ve got to doctor up. You’ve got to bake that
pain out of your lung, kill that cough, knock out the
headache and fever, keep warm and dry. Take care
of yourself. Remember you’re not so hardy as you
were three years ago.”</p>

<p>Steve nodded, grinding the pipe-stem between his
teeth.</p>

<p>“Them three years would of kilt me, but I had to
live to git Snake.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Now I’ll go home and send up the best
medicine I have. It isn’t much: mostly quinine. But
you take it. To-night, when there isn’t much chance
that anybody’ll be prowling up here, you make a fire,
boil some water, bake your chest with hot cloths.
Marion can fix you up a mustard plaster, too, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
fetch it back with the medicine; you wrap it around
that lung, and it ought to draw out the misery. I’ll
send you up some good wool socks, too. And you
wear ’em! Now will you follow Old Doc Hampton’s
orders?”</p>

<p>“I’ll foller ’em, Hamp.”</p>

<p>“Good enough. Now I’ll go get that medicine.”
He arose and clapped on his hat. “I won’t be back
here myself unless I’m needed—the fewer that come
here the better. But take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>Steve gripped the extended hand, his face softening.</p>

<p>“Much ’bliged, Hamp. An’ take care o’ yer own
self. Snake’s a-fixin’ to git ye some way, I bet ye.
Cuss him, will I ever git to him?”</p>

<p>In the cavernous eyes, in the prediction of trouble
from Snake, were a significance which Douglas was to
remember later on, but which he hardly noticed now.
He only answered the rebellious question.</p>

<p>“Not until you’re able to handle him. Right now
you can’t even handle yourself.”</p>

<p>Steve’s mouth tightened in angry admission that he
realized it. With a last long draw at the pipe he
handed it back.</p>

<p>“I’ll handle him right rough ’fore long,” he gritted.
“G’by.”</p>

<p>With a nod and a smile Douglas followed Marion,
who, still wordless, now was half out of sight in the
lower entrance. Down they went, passing through a
series of smaller caverns, twisting and crouching and
dropping, until they came out into sunlight. Before
them, hardly a rod away, rose the face of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
cliff. Around were bowlders half as big as houses.
Among these the girl led an irregular way—and they
were under an overhanging crag, looking out across
the Traps.</p>

<p>Looking back, he decided that any one would have
an extremely difficult time in finding Steve’s covert
unless guided to it. Once away from here, he doubted
whether he himself could retrace his course. Marion’s
dream-cave was as complete a hiding-place as could
well be imagined: double entrances and exits, both almost
impossible of discovery, the upper one forming
a natural flue for a night fire; well-watered, with wood
at hand for the taking, plenty of air and sufficient
light; yes, it was almost ideal—until the snows should
come.</p>

<p>“Go careful down here,” the girl’s voice broke in
on his reflections. “It’s pretty rough. Here’s where
I took a fall the night the catamount ’most got me.”</p>

<p>Down again they went, over a steep talus; among
more bowlders, and out at last on grassy, bushy soil;
through undergrowth to a faint foot-track running
north. Along this they trod for some time in silence.</p>

<p>“If it’s a fair question, what did Steve mean by
saying he was born like a wolf-pup?” he asked at
length.</p>

<p>“It’s so,” she said, half reluctantly. “His—his
folks wasn’t married, and his pop went off and left his
mom ’fore Steve was borned, and he never come back.
His mom, she went kind of queer into the head about
it. She was into the woods all the time, a-travelin’
and a-whisperin’, folks say. Steve was borned outdoors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
like he says. She died pretty soon, and so he
hasn’t got any folks.”</p>

<p>Another long silence. Now he knew what Uncle
Eb meant by saying the boy had been born unlucky
and never had had a chance. Poor, pitiful little
tragedy of the hills! The girl deserted by her man
just when she most needed his companionship and
protection; the staring, whispering young mother-to-be
wandering in the leafy solitudes; the new little life
coming into the world as primitively as that of the
first-born son of mankind; the kindly old Mother
Earth taking back into her great bosom one more of
her daughters who had loved and lost—a tragedy ever
new, yet old as the trust of women and the callousness
of men. Poor little mother! Poor Steve!</p>

<p>He might have asked more about the boy—how he
had lived and grown—but a glance at the girl told him
she would say no more. In all his wanderings among
the people of the Traps, this was the first time any one
had told him anything about the past of another; and
even now it probably was told only because Steve himself
had virtually given permission. He asked nothing
further. It was she who now asked a question or two
of her own.</p>

<p>“When you asked him to come down to your house
had you forgot the ha’nt might git him?”</p>

<p>“By George, I did! Clean forgot that ha’nt of
mine. Is that why he wouldn’t come?”</p>

<p>“No-o, I guess not. Not so much. But mebbe
’twas one of the things he was thinkin’ about; he
figgers a lot of things into his head that don’t come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
outen his mouth. But tell me, jest what does that
ha’nt do? The same kind of things all the time?
Nobody else ever stayed there long ’nough to find out
if the ha’nt worked reg’lar. You know him pretty
well by now, I shouldn’t wonder.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t pay much attention to him. He—or
it—scared me green in the face the first night, but he’s
never done me any real harm, and I’ve never seen
anything in a white sheet gibbering at me—nor anything
else. But this is what I know about him.” And
he described the muffled footfalls in attic and stairway,
the rustling and movement of the mattress,
and the uncanny suggestion that <i>something</i> else was
there.</p>

<p>“Ooh!” She shuddered and looked nervously
around. Then, banishing the visions conjured up by
his words, she became practical. “Did you ever think
that mebbe the thing walkin’ round was a rat?”</p>

<p>“A rat? If he is, Mister Rat has feet as big as
pillows. I thought of it, yes. But it’s queer—I’ve
never heard a rat or a mouse scamper or gnaw in that
house. You’d think there would be plenty of them,
but I’ve never seen nor heard a sign. And I’m positive
it was no rat that got into bed with me.”</p>

<p>“M-h’m. Well, I wonder, now—do you want a cat?
We’ve got four of ’em, always pesterin’ round for
somethin’ to eat. They’re Spit and Spat and Fit and
Fat—I named ’em all my own self. Spit and Spat
are ugly and they make noises like their names. Fit
has fits and Fat’s fat. I’ll give you Spit if you want
him. He’s quick as lightnin’ and an awful good ratter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and he’ll be company for you, too. Leave that attic
door open and see what he’ll do. Want to?”</p>

<p>“All right,” he chuckled. “But if that heavy-footed
ha’nt steps on Spit’s tail and Spit raises the roof with
a gosh-awful yowl when I’m asleep—there won’t be
any house left. I’ll go head-first through the wall and
knock down the whole layout.”</p>

<p>She burst into a merry laugh, in which he joined.
Quickly she suppressed it, however, looking around
once more—not for a night-walking phantom this time,
but for something which prowled as stealthily by day,
ranging the whole countryside: the sinister pair whose
presence kept Steve in a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>“You hadn’t ought to make me laugh so sudden-like,”
she reproved. But as they went onward she
giggled several times, and he chuckled in sympathy.
Nothing more was said, however, until they emerged
into a small field. Before them, dingy and bare, stood
the Oaks house.</p>

<p>“Lost?” she smiled then, seeing his surprised look.
“Didn’t think it was so nigh, did you? We come
back by the short way—it don’t take half as long as
goin’. Tell me”—she drew closer to him—“what
you a-huntin’ pop for?”</p>

<p>He hesitated. Then, as bluntly as she had revealed
her knowledge of Lou and the bridge, he told her.
She did not seem much surprised, though she was
plainly disturbed.</p>

<p>“I was ’fraid so,” she murmured. “I figgered ’twas
somethin’ like that, after you brought that corn-hook
home. But if pop done that, ’twas Snake that put him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
up to it! Consarn him!” She stamped a foot in swift
wrath. “Snake! He <i>is</i> a snake—a nasty p’isonous
copperhead that bites without a warnin’! And he gits
clear while other folks pay!”</p>

<p>“Snake’s the man I want,” he acquiesced. “I’ve
been after him, too. But I want to get the truth out
of your pop. And I’ll get it——”</p>

<p>“I’m ’fraid you won’t,” she interrupted soberly.
“I’m ’fraid he’s gone for good. Seems like we’d
have heard somethin’ ’fore if he was a-livin’. Mebbe—mebbe
Snake done somethin’ to him that night.
Snake, he’s a-layin’ awful low since then; nobody’s
seen him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll come to light sometime. He’ll have to.
And now we have to look out for somebody else. I’ll
get down to the house and bring up that medicine.
By-by.”</p>

<p>“G’by.”</p>

<p>They parted, to his mingled regret and relief—for,
be a girl’s father ever so base, it is inevitably distasteful
to discuss with her that father’s ignominy. Down
the road he walked fast toward his own abode and the
waiting medicine.</p>

<p>With the sun-baked sand under his feet he realized
anew how unseasonably hot was the day. The air was
breathless, and heat-waves curved and twined visibly
along the highway. Soon he shed his coat and shoved
back his hat. As he neared his haunted house, too, he
became more and more aware that the atmosphere was
tainted by the same odor which had been breeze-borne
to his nostrils earlier in the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Then, rounding the little curve beyond which stood
the Dalton house, he checked his stride.</p>

<p>Beside the road, in his own yard, were a weather-beaten
wagon and a white horse. They were Uncle
Eb’s. The old man himself was not in sight.</p>

<p>Douglas jumped forward with increased speed.
Uncle Eb might be waiting for him in the house, but
that was hardly likely; the old man did not like that
house. Had something happened to him?</p>

<p>The explosive voice of Eb himself came to him. It
broke from the brushy land on the other side of the
road, mingled with sounds of progress through thick
going.</p>

<p>“—Jest like Jake Dalton,” it was saying, “jest like
I’m a-tellin’ ye. Hampton never had no hand into
this, though I wouldn’t blame him none s’posin’ he
had—— Wal! thar he is now!”</p>

<p>From the brush emerged Eb and two others: the
man-hunters, Ward and Bill. All were chewing tobacco
furiously. All looked pale.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” Douglas sharply demanded.</p>

<p>“Wrong! Good gosh, son, is yer nose stopped?
It’s Nat!”</p>

<p>Dumb, the blond man gaped at the three. Ward
and Bill were eyeing him keenly. Uncle Eb pulled
off his hat, mopped his brow on a sleeve, squirted a
mouthful of brown juice, and went on barking.</p>

<p>“Jest like Jake Dalton! He’s up into the bresh—’side
the brook—face down an’ deader’n—wal, ’most
as dead as Jake. He’s been ther’ three-four days,
these fellers think—ever sence he run outen yer house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
that night he left his cawn-hook. An’ this hot weather
to-day—wugh! I ain’t a-goin’ to High Falls to-day
after all. I’m a-goin’ right back home soon’s we—— Have
ye got a shovel? Nat needs a shovel powerful
bad.”</p>

<p>“What happened to him?” Somehow Douglas
knew the answer already, but he had to ask.</p>

<p>“What happened to Jake Dalton? I dunno. But
he’s jest like Jake—swelled up awful, an’ not a mark
onto him—no gunshot, no knife, no nawthin’—jest
dead! Ther’s sumpthin’ into that house o’ yourn, son—that
ha’nt or sumpthin’, I dunno—that kilt him jest
the same’s it kilt Jake. He run into the bresh an’ fell
down an’ died same’s Jake done. Have ye got that
shovel?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I’ll go borry one. Glad to git away a few
minutes. Hoss, c’m’ere! Whoa! G’yapalong!”</p>

<p>With an apprehensive backward look at the house
the agitated old fellow was off. The man-hunters spat
in unison, never taking their eyes off Douglas, who
still stared at the brush. Mechanically he got out his
pipe, loaded it, lit it, and puffed.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows,” he said presently, “this is news to
me. I’ve been hunting this Nat Oaks—he was the one
I suspected of knifing my dummy—but I didn’t finish
him. Looks bad for me, perhaps, but——”</p>

<p>“You’re in the clear,” cut in Ward. “We might
make out a case if we tried hard enough, but we ain’t
tryin’. If the stiff had wounds on him you might have
some explainin’ to do; and we’re goin’ to do some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
lookin’ round, anyhow. But unless somethin’ new
turns up we’ll leave the thing lay as it is.”</p>

<p>Douglas nodded and reluctantly stepped toward the
hidden brook. The other two remained where they
were.</p>

<p>A short distance in from the road he found Nigger
Nat. He was stark naked, his clothing having been
cut from him by the pocket-knives of the officers in
their search for wounds. Feet, hands, and face were
mired by the mud in which he had expired; and the
gross face now was a bloated mask of bestiality. Nowhere
on the torso was any mark.</p>

<p>Douglas took one rapid, comprehensive look. Then
he retired hastily to the road, where he reloaded his
hot pipe and awaited the return of Uncle Eb. Wordless,
two chewing and one smoking, the trio of city
men stood regarding the haunted house.</p>

<p>The ha’nt, which of late Douglas had carelessly regarded
as a sort of joke, was a joke no longer. With
his own eyes he had just looked on the horrid handiwork
of the grisly thing which stalked within those
walls by night. What was it? Why had it not closed
its fearful grip on his own throat? How long before
it would do so?</p>

<p>Perhaps Jake Dalton and Nat Oaks knew the answer
to the ghastly riddle. But their lips were sealed for all
time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>IN THE SHADOWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the house where Nigger Nat, assassin, had himself
been struck by the hand of Death in the night,
Douglas Hampton, alias Hammerless, alias Hamp, sat
alone.</p>

<p>Nigger Nat lay in his grave, if grave it could be
called; a hastily dug hole into which he had been
rolled like a dead skunk. No pretense of ceremony,
and certainly none of mourning, had graced his departure
from the sight of men. Nor was any headboard
set above his mound. As soon as he had been
disposed of, his burial party had departed with all
speed.</p>

<p>For the sake of the living, however, the spot where
he lay would be not only marked, but improved. Even
now his headboard was being carved—and by the man
whom he had attempted to murder. On a piece of
planking, found among the odds and ends of Jake
Dalton’s shed and dressed clean with the hatchet,
Douglas was cutting in deep, bold letters:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">NAT OAKS</span></p>

<p>He intended, too, to clear away the brush around the
mound and cut to it a straight trail from the road, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
that the women whom Nat left behind him could—if
they wished—visit his grave. But that work could
wait for another day. Now, while Hampton’s hands
were drawing his knife-point along the neat lines and
hollowing out the spaces between them, his mind was
reviewing the events since the interment.</p>

<p>For a time the four men, united in a common task
of humanity, had shelved their mutual distrust in
fruitless search for the cause of Nat’s death. With
Douglas’ tacit permission, the pair of officers had inspected
the house from roof to foundations, Uncle Eb
meanwhile narrating in full the tale of Jake Dalton’s
death. Douglas in turn had told of his first meeting
with Oaks, the fight with the dogs and Nat himself,
his whim to view the sunrise, his finding of the corn-hook
driven into the dummy. He did not, however,
deem it necessary to mention the warning note which
he had partly burned.</p>

<p>“The feller ye want to git,” Uncle Eb barked,
rounding on Ward and Bill, “is Snake Sanders! Git
him an’ ye’ve got the man that’s back of all the devil-work
into the Traps. If ye make him talk, ye’ll git an
awful lot o’ knowledge all to oncet.”</p>

<p>The pair, taking in everything and saying almost
nothing, had nodded slightly at this. And at length,
non-committal as to what they might plan to do, they
had gone. Before departure, however, Ward had
scoffed at the ha’nt.</p>

<p>“I don’t take any stock in this ghost stuff,” he said.
“Oaks was an old souse. Heart prob’ly was rotten
with booze. He came in here with a bun on, took a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
swipe at the dummy, got cold feet sudden—heard
somethin’, perhaps, a rat or somethin’—and beat it.
Heart quit on him and he croaked.</p>

<p>“This Dalton, you say he was a souse too. Funny
that two guys should croak the same way in the same
place, yeah. But if the booze you guys make around
here is as bad as the wildcat whiskey I’ve struck in
some other places, I ain’t much surprised. It’d kill
anybody that lapped it up for a steady diet. So long.
Come on, Bill.”</p>

<p>When they were out of the way, Douglas had talked
awhile with Uncle Eb. To him he had told something
of Steve’s condition, and from him he had learned
that Marion already knew of the finding of her father’s
body. In his straightforward way Uncle Eb
had gone to the nearest place—the Oaks house—for
the shovel, and had given her the news. She had said
little—“acted ’most like she was expectin’ sumpthin’
like that,” Eb said—and gone at once to her mother.</p>

<p>“An’ now ’bout you, son,—ye better not stay into
this place no longer,” the old man had concluded.
“Come up an’ live ’long o’ me, don’t ye want to?”</p>

<p>But the anxious invitation was declined with thanks.
Douglas had determined to do now something which
more than once previously he had thought of doing—to
remain awake all night and catch the ha’nt, if it
could be caught. The presence of the thing in his
house was a challenge to him; and if the phantom
walked to-night, he vowed, he would smash it or himself
be smashed. This intention, however, he kept to
himself, merely saying that he had been unharmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
thus far and knew no reason why he should not remain
so.</p>

<p>So, bearing with him the quinine and other medicines
which Douglas thought might be useful to Steve,
the old man had gone back to the Oaks house and
then home. Under the circumstances, Douglas himself
did not feel like intruding just then on the girl and
her mother; and the errand could be done just as well
by Uncle Eb. And now, back to the wall and eyes
lifting now and then to survey all around him, Hampton
was toiling on the headboard. And the hot day
was nearing its end.</p>

<p>Lucky, thrice lucky had been Steve’s refusal to accompany
him home, he thought: lucky for Steve, for
Marion, for himself. Alone, he had come back openly
and opportunely. With Steve he would have come
more slowly and furtively, and by that time the man-hunters
might have been scouting around in the woods
on an investigation tour—and promptly sprung on
their prey. There would certainly have been a fight,
and before it ended Hampton and even Marion might
have outlawed themselves. Yes, it was lucky all
around.</p>

<p>Leaning back, he inspected his handiwork, yawned,
and clicked his knife shut. Nigger Nat’s monument
was completed. Glancing through the open doorway
at the lengthening shadows, he lifted his brows and
pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>“Where’s the time gone?” he asked himself. “It’s
almost sundown. Better rustle some grub and clear
the decks for action against Mister Ha’nt. Hope this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
isn’t his night off. Do ha’nts work union hours, I
wonder? Midnight to daybreak, maybe? Might get
some sleep if I only knew. It’s going to be a long,
long night.”</p>

<p>He yawned again, drowsy from the heavy heat of the
day. When his supper was eaten and his pipe was
going he yawned still more widely. Twilight now
filled the great bowl outside—the oddly transparent
twilight of early evening in the Traps, which lay in
shadow while the sun still shone beyond the western
heights. Next would come the grayish blur of true
twilight, deepening gradually into night. And when
dense darkness should enwrap all things and the evil
man-killer of this house should begin to stir about—then
what?</p>

<p>He arose, stretching and shaking himself to cast off
his sleepiness. After a turn up and down the room
he lifted his gun, ejected the shells, tested the firing-pins
with a snap or two, looked carefully at the ammunition,
and reloaded.</p>

<p>“Little old gun, you’ve been a real pal,” he soliloquized.
“I bought you just because you looked
good and because I thought I might get a bit of hunting
somewhere up in this country before going back
to town. Little did I think you’d save a girl and blow
cats and dogs all to thunder and shoot at ha’nts——”</p>

<p>“Yoo-hoo!”</p>

<p>The musical call from outside cut short his monologue.
In three strides he was at the door. At the edge
of the road stood Marion. On the sand at her feet
rested a sack in which something was tumbling about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Don’t you never put down that gun, even when
you’re into the house?” she asked as he crossed the
grass-ground. He looked foolishly down at the forgotten
weapon, still gripped loosely in one hand.
Without awaiting an answer, she went on: “But you
need it, I shouldn’t wonder. Are you a-goin’ to stay
here now, after—after what come to pop?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Going to sit up to-night and see what will
happen.”</p>

<p>She contemplated him soberly, then looked down at
the bag.</p>

<p>“I figgered that’s what you’d do. I—I wish you
wouldn’t. But I brought down some company, like I
promised. This here is Spit.”</p>

<p>As if answering to its name, the moving thing in
the sack vented a catty spitting sound.</p>

<p>“You’ll want to shut the door and the winders, if
there’s any open, ’fore you untie his bag,” she cautioned.
“He’s wild, and he’ll go like a shot if there’s
any way outen the house.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him. Why do you wish I wouldn’t
stay here?”</p>

<p>She flushed a little, looked at him, dropped her eyes
again and stirred the sand with a foot.</p>

<p>“Why, you—you’re a neighbor, kind of. And you—you’ve
been good to Steve.” The name came in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Oh. I see. Did you take the medicine to
him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s a-takin’ care of himself. But he’s
wilder’n ever at Snake Sanders, now he knows about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
pop. He didn’t like pop much, but it makes him hate
Snake all the more. Where—where is pop?”</p>

<p>“Over yonder,” he told her gently. “In a day or
so you can go in. I’m going to cut a path. You’re not
blaming me for this thing, are you, Marion?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t. Mom, she’s wild jest now—says if
you never come here this wouldn’t happened, and so
on—but that’s foolish, and I told her so. She’ll git
over it. But”—the firm little jaw set—“if Snake
Sanders comes a-pesterin’ round once more now he
won’t never walk outen our yard! I’ll fix him my own
self!”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“With pop’s gun. ’Tain’t much good, but it’ll shoot.
I got it ready this afternoon, and if I see his sneakin’
face jest once I won’t ask questions. I never wanted
to see him ’fore, but I’m lookin’ for him now!”</p>

<p>It was no sudden flare of temper that brought forth
the threat. It was the cold wrath of the hills that
sounded in her quiet voice, the deathless hate of the
avenger that glimmered under her curving brows.
Once more Douglas studied a new Marion: a girl
resolute, reckless, ominously hard.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t do that,” he counseled. “Put the gun
on him, but don’t shoot. March him down here and
let me have him. Maybe I can make him clear Steve.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe,” she half agreed. “I’m a-goin’ now. It’s
gittin’ dark. G’by.”</p>

<p>She was gone, running lightly along the shadowy
road. Until she disappeared he stood watching her.
Then he lifted the bag and returned to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>Mindful of her caution, he shut the outer door and
closed the window of his sleeping-room before removing
the cord from the mouth of the sack. It was well
that he did. When the rangy, rumpled Spit was
dumped on the bare floor he gave one baleful glare at
the man towering over him, one swift survey of his
surroundings, one spitting comment on the place—then
he was not where he had been. He was tearing
about like tawny lightning let loose.</p>

<p>Douglas made no effort to pursue him. To do so
would have been as futile as chasing a comet. He
only stood marveling at the animal’s speed and wondering
whether he had not better let him out before
he shot bodily through a window-pane. What good
would Spit do here, anyway? He would be only a
complication in the still-hunt of the ha’nt. But—Marion
had taken the trouble to bring him, and—— Oh,
well, let him stay.</p>

<p>The lank, homely brute threw himself at every window,
every door, seeming hardly to have hit one before
he was at another. The man gave up even trying
to watch him. Moving to his supply-shelf, he cut a
chunk of raw bacon and held it until the baffled Spit
finally paused, looking for a new point of attack.
Then he threw the meat.</p>

<p>Spit jumped into the air, came down glaring, circled
the meat, spat at it, sniffed at it, tasted it, considered
it with tail yanking from side to side—and accepted it.
With famished speed he gnawed it down. When it
was gone he lapped his jaws and looked at the man
with a shade of friendliness. It was poor cat-food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
that smoked fat; but it was food, and the half-wild
creature would eat almost anything. In fact, he was
ready to devour more of the same.</p>

<p>But he got no more. The man placed on the floor
a cupful of water, then shoved his backless chair
against the rear wall and settled himself for the vigil.
The gloaming now was rapidly thickening into darkness,
and there was nothing to do but await events.</p>

<p>For some time he sat quiet, hearing only the solemn
chant of deep-voiced crickets, the muffled conversation
of katydids, the almost inaudible padding of the
cat’s feet on the boards. Now and then he vaguely
made out the lean form of the animal pausing near
him. Then it moved and vanished into the gloom, uneasily
inspecting every inch of the strange quarters.
Nothing else passed within his range of vision; nothing
stepped around up-stairs; nothing rustled in the
bedroom.</p>

<p>An hour droned past, and another crept on its way.
The silent man’s lids began to droop. His recently
formed habit of going to bed early was asserting itself.
So were the drowsiness and languor induced by
the bygone heat. The steady chirp of the crickets, too,
and the dull darkness—they were floating him gradually
away on an ebb of consciousness. He shook himself
awake, shifted his position, leaned forward, away
from the wall. With renewed alertness he probed the
gloom. Nothing was there.</p>

<p>Little by little another hour snailed along. Little by
little the watcher slumped farther forward. His gun
remained steady across his knees, his eyes stayed open;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
but his elbows were resting now on his thighs, and his
gaze was a somnolent squint, centered on nothing.
His body was half asleep, his mind more than half
asleep; for it was dreaming, seeing things gone by and
places far away, and other things much nearer—but
not in this house: some things, indeed, which had not
yet come about and might never come. And still nothing
occurred to disturb his reverie.</p>

<p>Physical discomfort, not ghostly alarms, roused him
again. The chair was hard, his position was growing
cramped, his muscles demanded better comfort. Scanning
the room again, he noted with surprise that he
could see much more plainly. The windows, too, were
light, and through them he could make out the darksome
bulk of the trees. The Traps gulf was wanly
illumined by a late-rising moon.</p>

<p>Stiffly he arose to stretch himself. Something
turned gleaming eyes at him. It was Spit, very quiet
now, crouched comfortably on the floor, watching two
doors—the open one into the bedroom and the closed
one at the foot of the stairs. Man and cat eyed each
other a moment. Then the man in turn looked toward
a door—the entrance to his own room, beyond
which waited his blankets and easy couch of bough-tips.</p>

<p>After all, why not? He could sit against the wall
there, rest his legs and back, and still keep awake.
Better take the cat in there, too; then he wouldn’t
start clawing up toward the bacon-shelf or making
other disturbance. Might as well be comfortable.
As soon as he heard the ha’nt begin to tramp around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
he could slip out and see whatever might be seen.
All right, he would do it.</p>

<p>By patient persistence, he inveigled the suspicious
but curious Spit into the rear room. Entering it himself,
he had an afterthought: he reached to the attic
door, turned its knob, swung it open, leaving free access
for the stair-bumping spook. Then he went into
his room and almost closed the door, leaving it only
a little ajar to obviate the fumbling and noise of knob-turning
when the time to leap out should come. Making
sure that Spit still was there, he relaxed against
the wall, gun ready beside him. And——</p>

<p>In less than twenty minutes all good intentions and
cats and ha’nts were obliterated from his mind by the
velvety hand of Sleep.</p>

<p>What time it was when he awoke he never knew.
But awake he did, to find himself lurching upward,
every nerve tense, his gun clutched in his right hand.</p>

<p>The door was open wider now—open nearly a foot.
In the room beyond lay slanting moonlight.</p>

<p>Out there, something was struggling.</p>

<p>Something was making a low, ghastly, inhuman
noise.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE DEMON OF THE DARK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Douglas</span> felt his hair lift and his skin prickle, ice-cold.
But he knocked the door wide and plunged out.
In the moonshine stood no horrible figure. The noise
was coming from the floor: a growling sound, a slithering
scrape, irregular paddings, and the scratch of
claws on wood.</p>

<p>There, in the semi-darkness between two windows,
a small huddle writhed in hideous combat. Rooted to
the floor, Douglas stood watching its contortions.
Gradually the writhing movements diminished. But
the low growl continued, and from the spot glared the
fiery eyes of a cat which had made its kill.</p>

<p>The man started from his paralysis. Scratching a
match along the wall, he held the little flare above his
head and stared until his fingers twitched back, burned.</p>

<p>“Well—I’ll—be——” he muttered, his voice trailing
into nothing.</p>

<p>He had looked on the ha’nt. He had seen Dalton’s
Death, murderer of men,—expiring in the jaws of a
tom-cat.</p>

<p>Snatching the gas-lamp from its nail, he got it to
burning and turned its ray on the uncanny little bunch
below. In the white radiance the thing stood out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
horrid clarity. Though merged together, it comprised
three separate parts. They were cat—rat—rattlesnake.</p>

<p>The cat’s teeth were clamped in the neck of the
reptile. The venomous fangs of the reptile were
hooked into the head of the rat. The head of the rat
was nearly hidden within the distended jaws of the
sinuous slayer.</p>

<p>This much of the story was plain at a glance: the
snake had killed the rat, begun to swallow its prey,
and in its turn been pounced upon by the lightning-leaping
Spit. But how had rodent and reptile come
here? Why had he never seen them before? Why
had Spit allowed the snake to get the rat first? Why
did that snake’s tail, still moving, give out no warning
burr?</p>

<p>Douglas wasted no more time in puzzlement. Instead
he began a close inspection—as close as seemed
safe, in view of the fact that the savage cat struck
viciously at him with hooked claws when he came too
near. It was by no means impossible that some snake-venom
might be on those claws, and the investigator
was wary of them. Moving around with the light, he
studied snake and rodent.</p>

<p>The rat was long, lank, and old. Its hoary hair, its
big feet, the tip of one whitish whisker still visible at
the edge of the serpent’s gaping mouth, all proved its
age. It was so old that it would move clumsily. In a
silent house its feet would thump on the floor. If it
descended stairs it would bump.</p>

<p>Nothing very queer about the rat. But about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
snake was something very queer indeed. Though it
was well grown—more than a yard long, in fact—and
thus should have been well equipped with the warning
buttons of its species, it had none. It was a rattler
without a rattle.</p>

<p>True, its tail bore a small rounded excrescence which
might be an incipient button; but not a real, well-developed
one. Somehow the tail looked blunt; as if a
rattle once had been there but had been cut off, accidentally
or otherwise. It kept moving, so that it was
rather vague in outline. There was no doubt, however,
about the absence of the horny joints which
should have been there.</p>

<p>Narrow-eyed, Douglas stood regarding that unnatural
tail. For no apparent reason, he suddenly wheeled
and looked at the windows. Against the panes was
pressed no leering face. Outside in the moonlight
stood no sinister form. Slowly he turned back. Into
his mind had flashed the picture of Snake Sanders
loosing from a box on Dickie Barre a copperhead.
Was the appearance of the snake in this house another
attempt of the same sort?</p>

<p>“No,” Reason told him. This thing had not been
brought here to-night. It must have been in the place
a long time. Two men had been killed by it. One,
whose freshly carved headboard even now stood
against the wall, had died several nights ago. The
other had been struck down last spring. Beyond a
doubt, this was what had ended the lives of Jake and
Nat—striking at their bare feet, driving them in blind
horror from the house, leaving on their skins only two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
tiny wounds which, days later, would be overlooked
by the men finding their frightful corpses in the woods
or the brush. This creature must have been here for
months.</p>

<p>His deductions were interrupted by Spit. Tiring at
last of worrying its broken enemy, or perhaps eager to
begin eating the rat, the cat loosed its hold and, ceaselessly
growling, stepped around and smelt at the gray-haired
victim of the snake.</p>

<p>“Hey! Quit that!” Douglas snapped. “You fool
cat, that rat’s poisoned! If you have the slightest
scratch on your lips or in your mouth you’ll die! Let
it alone!”</p>

<p>At the impact of his voice Spit leaped aside, spat at
him, stood flame-eyed, lips writhing and claws unsheathed.
So menacing was the appearance of the
creature, so evident its readiness to battle for possession
of that rat, that the man took a backward step.
Claws and teeth both might be envenomed; even if they
were not, he knew that an ordinary cat-bite sometimes
results fatally. But he did not intend to let the cat
commit suicide. True, the poison might not injure
the animal’s stomach, but if it entered the blood——</p>

<p>He shoved the bare flame of his lamp straight at
the snarling visage. It was the best move he could
have made. Had he attempted to grasp the animal,
or even to push it away with a foot, the maddened
creature might have sprung at him. At that moment
a mere man meant little to that wild brute. But before
the fire-demon imprisoned in that lamp, before
the searing blue-white tongue licking out at his face,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
even Spit’s savage heart quailed. Spitting furiously,
he sprang back.</p>

<p>Inexorably the flame followed him. It pressed him
back into the bedroom. Then the outer door was
drawn open. The light retreated. Spit sneaked back
into the main room—but the white-hot tongue was
waiting for him. It slid forward once more. Suddenly
it made a twisting swoop toward his mouth.
That was too much. With a snarly squall of panic a
tawny streak shot through the doorway into the night.
Spit was gone.</p>

<p>The door bumped shut. The man straightened up,
relaxed, chuckled shortly. Then he turned the light
again on the feebly squirming reptile and the lifeless
rat; studied them a moment more; looked at the clean
pine monument of Nat Oaks glimmering yellowish in
the background; pivoted on his heels and frowningly
contemplated the bedroom where both Jake and Nat
had met their doom. For some minutes he stood there,
playing the light over every visible inch of the room,
particularly along the floor. Suddenly he started
as if a dazzling ray had darted through his mental
fog.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” he muttered. “I’ll bet——”</p>

<p>In another three seconds he was flat on the bedroom
floor, shooting the light along the under side of the
bed. He saw a series of squares of rope, upholding
the thick corn-husk mattress. Within each square the
mattress bellied downward. And in one of those
rounded curves of cloth, near the outer edge of the
bed, opened a hole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Douglas lay there, staring up at that hole, until his
position grew cramped. It was round and smooth-edged;
the edges looked worn, as if something had
often passed in and out—something scaly, perhaps,
whose passage would wear away loose threads. The
sagging cloth hung not more than a foot above the
floor. And, now that his nose was near it, he became
conscious of a repellent odor—a smell suggesting
snakiness.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” He scrambled to his feet and took a
breath of clean air. His gaze fell on the rent left in
the middle of the bed by Nigger Nat’s steel. Swift
aversion to the whole room seized him. He spun about
and stepped out of it. And as he left it he did something
he never had done before—he pulled its creaky
door shut behind him. He was through with that
loathsome death-chamber for all time.</p>

<p>The dead snake now was almost motionless: only
the blunt tail still quivered in reptilian tremors. Giving
it only a passing glance, Douglas stopped before
the open staircase and swung the light slowly from side
to side, examining every step. When the all-revealing
radiance was centered on the top he stood as if puzzled.
Down to the bottom and up to the top he played
it again.</p>

<p>“H’m! How come?” he queried.</p>

<p>The darkness gave no answer. Only the solemn
crickets dirged on outside.</p>

<p>Up the echoing stairs he clumped, and on the groaning
boards above he deliberately moved about, searching
the dusty, dusky recesses of the eaves. Presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
the moving light stopped, shining steadily into one of
the front corners. Through the dingy cobwebs festooning
the nook he saw something which brought a
satisfied nod.</p>

<p>“One,” he said. With that he turned away and
began descending the stairs.</p>

<p>Almost at the bottom, he halted short. The downward-pointing
ray had revealed a thing hitherto invisible
despite his careful scrutiny of the stairs; something
which an up-ranging eye never would see, and
which was discernible from above only because the
swaying light had happened to strike on it.</p>

<p>“Two!” he exulted. “That’s it! I’ve got the combination
now. Farewell, Mister Ha’nt! Your little
mystery is busted flat.”</p>

<p>Yet the thing at which he was looking would hardly
seem to be the key to an enigma. It was only a hole,
very inconspicuous in the dirty wall, at the junction
of the lowest step with the door-casing. And the
thing which he had found up-stairs in the corner was
merely another hole.</p>

<p>Resuming his downward way, he trod across the
main room, leaned his gun against the wall, set his
lamp on the stove, filled his pipe, sat down on his
chair, puffed smoke, and chuckled.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Mister Rat, you’re caught with the goods
at last,” he informed the lank old rodent on the floor.
“You’re the noisy half of the ha’nt. You’re old and
stiff, and your feet used to bump down like a ghost’s
heels. You lived around here somewhere—out in the
shed, maybe, or up under the attic floor—and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
used to come out of that hole in the corner and ramble
around, looking for anything to eat. Poor old
Bumpety-Bump, I’ll bet you’re so ancient that you’ve
lost all your teeth; you certainly look nearly starved.
Anyhow, you’d find nothing up there, so you’d bump
yourself down-stairs. Probably you smelt my cheese;
I had some when I first came here, and Uncle Eb
brought me up a huge slab of it later on.</p>

<p>“But when you hit the bottom you were stuck.
That door was always shut. So you’d have to give it
up. And with that other hole right handy, why go
back up-stairs? You’d just ooze into that hole
and let it go at that. So would any other sensible
man.</p>

<p>“And that first night, when I came at you with a
cannon, you heard me before I could open the door.
So you just dived into the handy hole, and when I
yanked the door almost off its hinges you were tee-totally
gone. And while I was standing there growing
goose-flesh you were probably sitting up in the wall
and thumbing your old nose at me.”</p>

<p>He laughed again in quiet self-derision.</p>

<p>“It must have been tough, though, to come down
here every night, just drooling for that cheese, and
find yourself always blocked. All the same, that’s all
that saved your life. This other gent here, Mister
Side-Winder, must have been rat-hunting every night;
that’s why I’ve never heard rats around here; he got
’em all. And to-night when I left that door open and
you came out—well, you know as much about that as
I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“Mister Spit, our little guest of the evening, must
have followed my noble example and gone to sleep in
there. Or maybe he had a hard time pulling the door
open; it does stick when it’s almost shut. Anyhow, by
the time he catapulted himself into the plot of this
piece you were on your way down Mister Rattler’s
gullet—which was just as well for friend Spit, maybe.
He could maul Mister Side-Winder then without a
come-back. Glad of it, too. Spit’s manners have been
neglected, but he’s a regular fellow, and I’m glad he
didn’t have to go out by the same route as Jake and
Nat.”</p>

<p>He puffed again, and his smile died. When he
spoke again his voice was cold.</p>

<p>“And you, Yard-of-Poison—how did you get here?
You’ve been here since spring. Maybe you came out
too early, got caught in a cold snap, found Jake’s
door open, came in to get warm. Maybe. Anyway,
you’ve been here since then. You found a hole in
the under side of the mattress and crawled in among
the husks for warmth and concealment. At night you
got the warmth of Jake’s body, too. And you paid
for your lodging as a snake would. Some night when
Jake got up in the dark for something you struck his
foot. And while he died alone in the black woods
behind here you crawled back into your hole, well
satisfied with yourself.</p>

<p>“Some other fellows came, and you missed them.
They didn’t happen to come near you in the night, or
you had caught a rat and were sleeping it off in your
hole. And then I came. And you’re the thing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
rustled the mattress beside me that night, and made
the rickety old bed tremble—you’re the thing I <i>felt</i> in
the air, there in the room beside me. When I looked
under the bed you weren’t in sight: you had stopped
when you felt me move. But you came out later, all
right, and you’d have killed me if I’d stepped near you
without my boots. And every night since then you’ve
been sneaking around ready to get me. Lucky I
changed beds, and never came out here barefoot for
a drink in the night, and kept my door shut. Maybe
Uncle Eb’s right, and there’s a good angel watching
over me. Looks like it.</p>

<p>“And then Nigger Nat came, and you got him. I
owe you one for that, perhaps. But he was only a
tool. If you’d nailed Snake Sanders, now, I’d be
right obliged to you. But you’d never touch him, of
course, even if he stepped on you. He’s your brother.”</p>

<p>For awhile he smoked in thoughtful silence. The
buttonless tail now lay inert. Within the house the
only movement was that of his own puffing, the only
sound the stutter of his wet-stemmed pipe.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he resumed at length, “I wonder
whether your brother Snake knows anything about
how you lost your rattle. I wonder if he had a grudge
against Jake Dalton. If I ever get him in a corner
I’ll ask him about that. Yes, sir, I will.”</p>

<p>His pipe stuttered more loudly and went out. A
long yawn stretched his face. Reaching to the lamp,
he shut off the gas-flow and stood up.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he repeated, “I’ll give Snake a third-degree
on that point sometime. And until then I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
just keep my mouth shut about your demise. I’ll
throw you two folks back into the woods to-morrow,
and I’ll let folks think the ha’nt is still ha’nting. And
now, with your kind permission, I’m going back to
bed. Good-night, Mister Ha’nt—good-night forever.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>CROSS TRAILS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">November</span> marshaled her gray hosts and marched
them across the Shawangunks.</p>

<p>Out of the west they came, a slow, silent, grim array
of clouds, drifting steadily above the puny barrier
of the mountains, covering the sky from rim to rim—a
vast army which alternately smeared out the sun
and allowed it to break through the gaps between their
brigades. At times they closed into mass formation
and drizzled cold scorn down on the impotent hills and
the insignificant dwellers therein. Then they drew
apart and resumed their indifferent, disorderly route-step
across the heavens, perhaps to spit again on the
New England mountains farther east and then swing
northward to merge into the fogs and snows of bleak
Labrador. Even when they passed in straggling
groups instead of a long battle-line, they gave the sun
scant opportunity to light up the whole countryside at
once, as he recently had done. Ever their chill
shadows were creeping along the ground, darkening
long belts of hill and dale while other strips were
agleam with light. Only at night, it seemed, did they
draw off into bivouac, leaving the sky clean and clear.
Then across the land sped their night-flying ally, Jack
Frost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>And with the recurrence of that biting chill the silence
of approaching winter fell on the depths of the
Traps. At last the katydids were still. So, too, were
the crickets. By night, when the music of hammer
and drill was hushed and the cheery voices of roosters
and hens were silenced by slumber, the stillness would
have been painful but for the gentle murmur of Coxing
Kill, singing softly to itself as it crept past the humble
homes of the hillmen and on into the north. Only a
few weeks more, and even the friendly little stream
would lose its voice under the merciless grip of winter
ice. Then indeed stark silence would hold the great
bowl at night—desolate, bitter silence broken only by
the sough of wind-beaten evergreens and the groans of
cold-tortured hardwoods.</p>

<p>That time was not quite come. But even now the
face of the Traps was gaunt and harsh. Gone was the
velvety mask of green which had partly hidden the
austerity of the land; gone, too, the flaunting colors
which had replaced the emerald tone. Through the
thinned forest everywhere showed thickly strewn bowlders
and the grim barrenness of crag-face and naked
rock slope. The vistas through the brush lengthened
in all directions. And with this opening of the woods
a new, sullen, ominous noise began to shock the quiet
air from time to time—the sulphurous explosion of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Thus far, the guns of the Traps had been noticeably
silent. Only at long intervals had one spoken.
So dense was the undergrowth that the Trapsmen,
knowing they had little chance of sighting game, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
almost entirely refrained from hunting. But now the
deep roar of muzzle-loading shotguns smashed the
stillness early and late, varied occasionally by the blunt
bang of some black-powder rifle. Mother Nature,
hitherto the protectress of her feathered and furred
children, now was betraying them into the hands of
men. All hunted things moved with increasing peril.</p>

<p>Yes, all hunted things—human as well as animal.
Hunted men, and the friends of those men traversing
the brush in furtive missions, were concealed but
thinly now by the leafless branches. And while most
of the hunters prowling the wilds were seeking only
meat and sport, there were also those who stalked
more dangerous game.</p>

<p>Three of them, there were. But they did not work
together. In fact, one of the three avoided the others,
who worked always as a pair. Yet their separate
trails crossed at times, and at such times there was a
verbal fencing, a give-and-take of half-humorous
banter with an undertone of menace. Hammerless
Hampton, free ranger, hunter of Snake Sanders and
silent partner of Steve, outfaced or outmanœuvred
Ward and Bill, who also sought Snake but whose more
important quarry was that same Steve—and who, consequently,
scrutinized Hampton’s movements at every
opportunity.</p>

<p>“When we git somethin’ on you, Hampton, we’ll
gather you right in,” Ward reiterated in sardonic
humor. To which Douglas, with devil-may-care smile,
would reply: “All right. But it’ll take both of you to
do it. How’s business?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“Oh, pickin’ up all the time,” with a carelessness
that might or might not be assumed. “We know
about where one of our guys is hangin’ out, but we’ll
let him lay until we git to talk to the other one a little.
We’re gittin’ a good vacation, and we ain’t in any
rush.”</p>

<p>How much of this ambiguous answer was true
Douglas could not tell. And, suspecting that it was
purposely phrased to evoke questions from him, he
made no queries as to which of the “guys” was being
spared while the other was sought. Nor did he ever
allow his eyes to stray in the direction of Steve’s
subterranean cavern; he knew Ward was subtly tempting
him to give some involuntary indication of his
knowledge of the fugitive’s retreat, and he gave none.
He observed with misgiving, however, that the pair
now seemed always to be somewhere near Dickie
Barre.</p>

<p>Ward’s half-jest about the “vacation,” though,
seemed to hold much of truth. He looked like the
instinctive outdoorsman, who really would derive much
pleasure from working in rough country. Certainly
both he and Bill showed the good effects of open-air
life: the city sleekness of flesh and redness of face were
gone, and they were more lean of frame, more lithe of
movement, brown of skin and clear of eye. Bill still
wore the sour look which seemed habitual, and toward
Hampton he always maintained a grouchy silence—perhaps
because he knew he would get the worst of
any verbal encounter. But, from the physical standpoint,
there could be little doubt of his ability to hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
his own with almost any one. He and his mate now
were a formidable combination.</p>

<p>“If it’s not a sassy question, how do you fellows
manage to live in here?” Douglas wondered at one of
their unexpected meetings. “Shouldn’t think you’d
find it easy to get food and shelter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s easy. We’ve got a little shelter of our
own, where nobody’ll bat us over the dome when
we’re sleepin’. And for grub, we have a wagon that
comes up every so often from down below; meets us
outside, and we pack in the fodder. Anything else
you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Sure. How much longer are you staying?”</p>

<p>“Till we git our man, of course. Do I have to
keep tellin’ you? It’s takin’ a little longer than we
thought, but we’ll be here as long as he is.”</p>

<p>The quiet determination of the tone stirred Hampton’s
admiration despite himself.</p>

<p>“You ought to be on the Royal Northwest
Mounted,” he laughed. “You have the same stick-to-the-trail
doggedness.”</p>

<p>“I was with ’em,” was the unexpected reply. “Five
years ago. Up in Alberta. Too much snow. Too
much horse. Too lonesome. But I know what stickin’
on the trail means, yeah. This here stuff is nothin’
but play, lined up alongside of some things I seen.”</p>

<p>The simple statement was a revelation to Douglas.
Bill of Brooklyn, if left to himself, would have quit in
disgust before now. But Ward, former R. N. W.
M. P., would never abandon his quest until officially
called in—or unofficially shot. He would imperturbably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
stick until the coming of the snows should make it
impossible for any one to carry food to Steve without
leaving a trail. And with the laying of that trail he
would run his man to earth in no time. The sky
suddenly looked very black for Steve.</p>

<p>But the blond man strove to keep his thoughts out
of his face, and after a few more words he passed on,
cudgeling his brain for some means of helping the
fugitive to evade the remorseless power creeping closer
and closer to his covert. A number of ways had previously
occurred to him, but none of them was feasible
in view of Steve’s own refusal to leave his native environment,
his determination to die first “like a wolf—into
the rocks or the trees.” Against that immovable
decision what could he do? Nothing.</p>

<p>Nothing except the thing he now was trying to do—corner
Snake Sanders. If cornered, Sanders might
possibly be forced to clear Steve. The hope was slim,
but still there was a chance—<i>if</i> he could corner
Sanders! The thought revolved on itself and maddened
him with its futility. The man Sanders was
still eluding him, and, despite Ward’s nonchalance,
undoubtedly was evading the officers also. And the
telltale snow which must reveal Steve’s refuge might
come at any time now.</p>

<p>Through Marion, he knew that the earth-bound boy
had fought off his lung-pains and was somewhat
stronger, though by no means well. For the present,
therefore, he was not worrying over the youth’s condition.
In fact, he had asked himself a couple of
times why he should take so deep an interest in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
fellow anyway; then he had left the question unanswered,
merely telling himself that “the poor kid’s
in hard luck, and he’d do as much for me—maybe.”
He had not faced squarely the fact that the basic
motive for his sympathy was his desire to aid the girl.</p>

<p>He had seen her several times since the death of
the ha’nt, but only for short periods. Her mother, he
learned, still was bitter against him, and—as perhaps
might have been expected from one of her type—persisted
in putting on him some of the blame for the
death of her “man.” Marion herself, though frankly
asserting that she had no patience with such an attitude,
was pensive and rather reserved in manner.
Therefore he refrained from unnecessary calls.</p>

<p>She had asked him, of course, about his success in
hunting the ha’nt; indeed, she had shown unmistakable
relief when he rambled into her yard the next
day to ask whether “Spit got home all right.” In
pursuance of his decision to keep hidden for the present
the annihilation of Dalton’s Death, he had answered
evasively, telling her truth but not all of the
truth: that Spit had torn madly about in an effort to
escape, that the door had swung open later on and
the cat had run out, that he himself had tired of
watching and fallen asleep on his blankets. “And
you can see for yourself,” he concluded, “that nothing
gobbled me.”</p>

<p>And since then he had been steadily seeking Sanders.
He had changed his hunting-ground now from the
vicinity of Snake’s shack to a section nearer his own
house—the long wall of Dickie Barre. Thither he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
been led by an idea of his own, and there he worked
day after day with a grim persistence equalling that
of Ward and Bill, coupled with a methodical thoroughness
which they might well have emulated.</p>

<p>The germ of his idea was the recollection of his
first meeting with Steve and of Marion’s production of
the jug which, she said, belonged to Snake. She had
not gone far that morning to get that jug. So, starting
from the well-remembered crack among the bowlders
where his camp had been, he now delved into
every crevice and cavern within a radius of a few
minutes’ traveling time from that focal point.</p>

<p>He found snakes, but none with legs. In one gloomy
passageway leading inward he was halted by a rustle
among leaves just ahead. His ears telling him that the
sound was too slight to be made by stealthily moving
feet, he hazarded the light of a match—and found
himself in a den of copperheads. The deadly reptiles
had abandoned the well-watered lower lands and
sought higher ground to bed themselves down for the
coming winter, and now they lay in a sluggish knot,
nearly buried among the leaves. Their lifted heads
and unwinking stare, however, showed that they were
by no means too numb to attack; and Douglas, though
well booted to the knee, had no desire to tread among
them. Moreover, the presence of the reptiles and the
untrodden appearance of the leaves virtually proved
that no man was beyond. Wherefore he withdrew.</p>

<p>In other recesses farther north he found, at times,
evidence of the occasional visits of men, clandestine
or otherwise; the mute testimony of charred fagots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
and smutted stone, of scrapes on rock and of indentations
showing that weighty things had stood for some
time in certain spots. These traces, however, all indicated
bygone activities, not recent occupancy.
Whatever had been carried on in those crevices and
culs-de-sac, both the equipment and the products now
had vanished. Whether the evanishment was due to
the fact that the Law still prowled about was a question
which did not concern the silent hunter. He was
looking for a man, one man; and, not finding that man
or his lair, he moved on without delay.</p>

<p>Then came an unexpected impetus to his search.
One afternoon, as he was threading his way around a
bulk of detritus which obviously contained no opening,
a drab figure detached itself from a massive tree-trunk
near at hand. He looked into the foxy face of
the little cooper, David McCafferty.</p>

<p>“Jest a-layin’ for a couple o’ squir’ls,” Davy explained
his presence. “Havin’ any luck?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. I’m hunting—snakes.”</p>

<p>A shrewd nod and a glance around followed. In a
hoarse whisper the barrel-maker informed him: “I
hearn ther’s a bad one—wust one round here—been
seen down ’long here a piece. Mebbe ’bout haff a mile
or so down. I dunno nothin’ ’bout it. But ther’ might
be somethin’ into it.”</p>

<p>With another quick look around, he retreated to his
tree. Douglas, without trying to render unwanted
thanks, waved a hand and went on. A little later he
heard behind him two roaring gunshots, and hoped
Davy had bagged both his squirrels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>He did not, however, swing away through the woods
for an estimated half-mile and there resume his conning
of the crags. Davy’s directions had been too indefinite,
and he was determined not to leave an unexplored
gap in his steadily lengthening line. His system
was to cover as much ground as he could in each
short day, leaving some sort of marker at the point
where twilight compelled him to cease, then return to
that marker the next morning and do another section.
Thus, though his progress through the welter of stone
was necessarily slow, he was making it absolutely sure.
And now he held himself to the deliberate course he
had set.</p>

<p>When the dusk descended he had laboriously made
certain that Sanders’ hide-hole, if he had one along
here, was somewhere to the north of a buttress-jut
beside which he had stopped. After fixing that outcrop
firmly in memory and lightly blazing a couple of
beech saplings with his pocket-knife for reassurance
the next morning, he swung down through the brush
to the road and home to his cheerless house.</p>

<p>“Ho-hum!” he yawned over his after-supper pipe.
“I’m beginning to sympathize with Ward. Hunting
down a man in this old Indian stronghold is real work.
If it weren’t for Davy’s tip to-day I’d begin to think
Snake was dead somewhere, like Nigger Nat. But
there’s no such luck. Well, Snake, maybe to-morrow
night I’ll know more about you.”</p>

<p>The vague hope was to become terrible truth. To-morrow
night he would know much more about Snake
Sanders—including something which would stagger
the entire Traps.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>NINETY-NINE’S MINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammerless Hampton</span> stood very still.</p>

<p>Once more he was among the rocks. But these
grotesque bulks around him were new; he never had
penetrated into this group before. In fact, but for
his careful observation of every opening he would not
be here now. He had spied a hole in what seemed to
be the solid precipice, beyond which showed light instead
of the usual gloom. Crawling through, he had
found himself in a big space whose existence was
concealed by the false face of the cliff. It was one of
the freaks of the long-vanished glaciers, perhaps, moving
outward a long line of solid stone and leaving beyond
it a big gouge in the real butte. At any rate, it
was queer.</p>

<p>But this was not what held Douglas so quiet; he had
long since ceased to marvel at the fantastic formations
along his line of exploration. Now, after passing
among a number of small bowlders—that is, no larger
than a three-room house—he stood beside a hole opening
downward. And beside that hole lay several
charred matches.</p>

<p>In his mind those tiny stubs loomed larger than the
long wall itself. Some man had been here quite recently:
at some time since the latest rain, which would
have pelted those cylindrical sticks down along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
sloping stones on which they lay. And that man was
no hunter, for no hunter would ever bother to enter
this barren box. Indeed, no hunter would even find it,
for he would be scanning ground and branches, not
the naked rock-face.</p>

<p>Warily the discoverer glanced at the corners of the
surrounding stones. No spying eye met his; no half-hidden
head moved. He looked down again at the
opening.</p>

<p>It was a hole made by the uptilting of a once horizontal
slab. It was near the true face of the butte.
At some time, perhaps not long distant, a mass of overhanging
stone had crashed down from above, a jutting
segment striking this slab at one end and angling the
other end upward and aside by the force of impact.
Before then, the horizontal block had been a sort of
trap-door, concealing the cavity beneath. Now, plain
to any eye which should reach this place, the opening
revealed a few flat stones leading downward, markedly
resembling crude stairs.</p>

<p>Across Hampton’s face shot a sudden startled look—the
astounded incredulity of a skeptic beholding in
solid actuality a thing which he had believed to be
mere legend. For minutes he stood as if hypnotized
by the gloom below. Then, recovering himself, he
stepped very quietly into a position where he could
obtain a more direct view of the descent.</p>

<p>He saw little more. The steps vanished into the
blackness of a vault. What lay beyond could be determined
only by exploration. Exploration meant
light; and, barring the few matches he always carried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
he had no means of illumination. Moreover, he felt
issuing from the depths a draught which probably
would kill the feeble match-flames before they could
reveal anything worth seeing. He must return to the
house and bring up his gas-lamp.</p>

<p>But then, moving again, he caught a glint from down
the steps—a glint of metal. Logic told him that the
other man who came here must have used those
matches in lighting a lantern. If that faintly shining
thing down there was it, then the man must be away
at present. He stole closer, straining his eyes—then
stepped boldly forward. There was little doubt now
that he saw the circular top of a cheap oil lantern,
and he believed he could also make out the dull-colored
wire bail.</p>

<p>With some difficulty he folded himself up enough to
crouch under the tilted lid and begin descent. After
a couple of steps he could move more easily, and by
the time he reached the lantern he was erect again.
Lifting the lantern, he shook it and frowned. The
light swash at the bottom told him that the oil was
almost exhausted.</p>

<p>If a large cave lay beyond, he would have to be
careful not to go too far from the entrance. Left
lightless, he might find himself in a desperate plight.
Even as the thought passed through his mind there
came to his ears a faint gurgle of subterranean waters.
Yes, he must watch his step, and his flame too. But
he would see what he could.</p>

<p>Two matches were extinguished by the damp
draught as he sought to light the blackened wick. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
third, however, communicated its flame to the oily
weave, and the snapping down of the sooty chimney
preserved the dim shine within. Unlike the owner of
the lantern, Douglas did not leave his match-stubs
where they fell. He gathered them up and dropped
them into a pocket.</p>

<p>Gun ready, he stole on downward. There were
perhaps a dozen more of the steps, not one of which
was truly horizontal; all sloped in one direction or another,
and no two were of the same height. Some
were so poorly balanced that they rocked under him,
and all evidently had been piled in by unskilled human
hands, long ago. But Douglas, cat-footed from his
daily experience among the bowlders, passed down
them as easily as if they had been a marble staircase
constructed by expert workmen. They terminated on
a downgrade of damp, hard earth.</p>

<p>The passage led on, narrow but fairly straight, for
quite a distance. All at once it broadened out. At the
same time the blackness became noticeably less dense.
Faintly, here and there, showed grim rock walls—mere
patches of stone, vague in the farther gloom, revealed
by wan daylight filtering through some crevices
high up and opening eastward. Simultaneously the
hollow gurgle of the running water increased in
volume. It sounded somewhere beyond.</p>

<p>A moment Douglas stood there, straining his eyes,
seeing little. The dim lantern-light seemed to hinder
rather than to help, preventing his pupils from dilating
to the full width which might have brought more of
the place into view. He felt an impulse to extinguish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
it. But it would go out of its own accord all too soon;
perhaps if he did blow out the flame the wick would
refuse to take a new light. He let it burn, and began
moving about.</p>

<p>Before he moved far, however, he retraced his steps
and spread on the uneven floor his handkerchief.
Three corners of the cloth he folded in to the center,
leaving the fourth protruding in a white angle toward
the entrance. With this marker in place he advanced
again, watching the dirt for any yawning crack, pausing
to look around, then resuming his way. After a
little while he reached the farther wall, having found
nothing. There he halted.</p>

<p>The light-crevices were plain enough now—mere
cracks in the stone, back whence he had come, from
twenty to thirty feet up. Off to his left sounded the
rumbling of the water: an eerie, gruesome noise unlike
the gentle murmur of Coxing Kill; a gargling and
choking, as if some inhuman monster were gulping at
an unseen Styx. Before he could decide whether to
go and look at it, something to the right caught and
held his gaze—a shadowy, shapeless thing which gave
the impression of solidity but not of stone. He worked
toward it.</p>

<p>As he approached, it took on form and outline—a
confusion of ancient timbers and rock-chunks which
seemed to be a tumble-down furnace, or something of
the kind. Just what it might have been he could not
determine at once: but it certainly was a work-place,
and very old.</p>

<p>His toes stubbed on something. The lantern proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
the obstruction to be the remains of a heavy hammer,
half eaten away by rust. As he moved again, his
lantern-light glinted dully on metal not far from the
ruined forge—if forge it was. His interest quickened.
Metal not dimmed by rust—what was it?</p>

<p>Stepping toward it, he stumbled again. A heavy,
dull-colored obstacle on the dirt had blocked his feet.
It was not especially large, but it certainly was solid,
as his tingling toes testified. It seemed to be a rudely
shaped bar of metal. And it was not rusty.</p>

<p>“Great guns!” he breathed. “Is it true? Silver?
Tarnished silver?”</p>

<p>As he stared at it, it began to grow dim. Was it
about to vanish into the ground like a legendary treasure?
No, it was not sinking; it was still there;
but——</p>

<p>The light was going out.</p>

<p>The little flame had shrunk. It still was shrinking.
Angrily he shook the lantern. A thin—very thin—slosh
of oil answered him. There was still a little fuel—enough
to last several minutes, at least. But the
wick must be short.</p>

<p>The shaking gave a brief respite. The flame revived
a trifle, feeding on the oil-dregs thrown on the
wick. Swiftly he stepped toward the glimmering
thing he had first seen. It was on the floor, and beside
it rose a number of those solid bars, piled like
wood. It was a tin can, recently emptied.</p>

<p>After one glance at it he pushed rapidly on toward
the outer wall, determined to see as much as possible
by the last light in the lantern. He found still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
of those bars, and, beyond them, something made much
more recently: a thick, comfortable bed of leaves, on
which lay open a coarse, dirty quilt. Beside this, at
what seemed to be the head of the primitive couch,
and within easy reach of a man resting there, stood
a big jug. Somehow it looked familiar. Its nozzle
was plugged with a stout corn-cob, and—yes, on one
side was an old smear of green paint!</p>

<p>“Thought so,” nodded Douglas.</p>

<p>Memory was depicting a bygone morning among the
rocks to the south; a red-haired girl, a gaunt-faced
youth, a jug which the girl declared to be the property
of Snake Sanders—a jug bearing the same green
splotch. Its presence here was conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>All was growing dusky again. The light was going
for the last time. It was no longer a flame, but a mere
sunken line, turning blue; and from the spent wick
rose a warning reek. With a shake that made the
foul globe chatter angrily within its wires, he turned
and gripped one of the cold metal bars. For its size,
it was astoundingly heavy. He had meant to carry it
under one arm, but its sullen weight and clammy
slipperiness forced him to hug it in both. With bar
and gun both cradled across his body and lantern
dangling crazily from one finger, he moved for the
exit.</p>

<p>It seemed to be nearer than he had thought. The
last flickers of the expiring light revealed a black gouge
in the wall. Into it he turned, muttering to the lantern:
“All right, quit! I don’t need you any more.”</p>

<p>The overworked wick did quit, leaving him in utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
blackness. Half a dozen more steps he took, watching
for the first vague dayshine from beyond. Then he
halted as if petrified. He remembered his handkerchief.
And he remembered that he had not seen it
on turning in here.</p>

<p>Carefully he lowered his burden. With hands free,
he struck a match.</p>

<p>“Wow! You can back-track, Mister Man!” he
muttered.</p>

<p>Less than a yard ahead opened a wide rift in the
floor. One more step in the dark would have trapped
him in a pit where death, swift or slow, would inevitably
have obliterated him; death from the fall,
from starvation, or from Snake Sanders’ merciless
hands.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can back-track,” he repeated. “Wouldn’t
Snake have a lovely afternoon with you if he found
you in there, all busted up? He’d drop in a few of
his squirmy chums to keep you company, most likely,
and have the time of his life watching the show. And
if he didn’t find you, nobody else ever would. Now
use your brains, Hamp, if you have any, and find the
right way out.”</p>

<p>Conning the situation, he realized that the most important
feature was saving matches, of which he had
very few. Therefore he groped until he had located
bar, gun, and lantern; gathered them up, turned carefully,
and felt his way back by keeping an elbow
against the rough wall of the false passage. When
the stone ended he halted again, laid down everything,
lit another fire-stick, and, carefully shielding the flame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
from draught, advanced to the left. As he walked he
counted his steps.</p>

<p>Three matches in turn burned out. The third, however,
brought him within sight of a white splotch several
feet to his left. The fourth proved it to be his
pointer.</p>

<p>He now had only two matches left. But he knew
the number of steps, including the turn he had made
toward his handkerchief: he had the vague crevice-lights
to aid his calculations for the return, and he
had approximately the right direction in mind. Deducting
from his total count the few steps taken on
the last angle, and concentrating every sense into the
task of traveling straight, he marched back through
the darkness. So true was his course that with the
last step his foot struck the invisible lantern.</p>

<p>Once more loaded, he sought the exit, saving both
matches. But his steps were a trifle shorter now that
he was burdened, and he also strayed a little from his
line. It took both matches to set him right at the end;
the second was almost out before he could even see the
white, and before he could reach the marked spot the
light was gone. However, he found the opening in
the wall; and when he went groping along the passage
he had retrieved his handkerchief. The only traces
of his visit now were the last two match-butts, which
he had had to drop.</p>

<p>The wan light of day had seldom been so welcome
as when, after a scraping, stumbling journey, he
emerged at length at the crude staircase. With a long
breath of relief, he clambered up to the step whereon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
he had found the lantern. There he replaced the
grimy light-giver on the exact spot where he had discovered
it. On upward he continued, and out from
under the tilted lid he crept.</p>

<p>No new sign of human presence was visible outside.
He strode around the nearest bowlder. Behind its
sheltering bulk he laid down his bar of loot and began
close inspection of it.</p>

<p>With his clasp-knife he scraped away an accumulation
of dark sediment, baring a narrow strip of the
true metal. From the clean space shone a dull silvery
gleam.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” he breathed. “Sure as shooting,
it’s—— But wait, now. Let’s see.”</p>

<p>He dug the point of the strong blade into the metal.
Turning it, he easily cut out a conical chunk. After
scanning it an instant, he pressed his thumb-nail down
on one circular edge. The nail bit out a clean gouge.
For a couple of seconds more he stared at the little
plug of metal, at his knife-blade, at his nail and the
end of his thumb. Then he lifted his head and laughed—silently,
but so heartily that tears came to his eyes.</p>

<p>He knew now what it was that the long-dead Ninety-Nine
had dug from the bowels of that shadowy
cavern; what it was that the Indian who sought the
aid of old Elias Fox had borne away from the mine;
what the old man’s sly glimpse had depicted as virgin
silver, and what his son and grandsons since had
sought until crushing doom annihilated one of them.
His laughter ended as he eyed the great block whose
fall from above had pried up the stone trap-door.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
That might be the very mass which had hurtled down
on Will Fox. Under it even now might be lying his
splintered bones.</p>

<p>Dubiously he eyed the cliff above, half dreading
another such fall. But there was no overhang of
stone now, no danger of another drop. He let his
thoughts run back again.</p>

<p>Long ago he had perceived the flaw in the tradition
that “where the sun first strikes the wall, there is the
mine.” The sun, moving north or south with the
changing seasons, would cast its first beams on different
points of the wall at varying times of year.
Even when he had climbed the Mohonk slope to see
the sun rise he had been aware of this; and since then
he had relegated the whole story to the realm of myths.
Yet the mine was real enough, and he had found it
at last; and, through his good-humored promise to
Lou Brackett, part of it belonged to her.</p>

<p>But Snake, Lou’s own man, had found it before
him. This was why he had been so elusive of late;
this was where he had been most of the time, evading
all eyes and perhaps working to get more mineral
from the vein. Was it likely that he would share his
secret with Lou? Hardly. Perhaps he intended soon
to drive her from him, and hoped—the thinker’s face
hardened—hoped with his new-found wealth to gain
possession of Marion.</p>

<p>The thought brought him to his feet. Where was
Snake now? What was he doing? Was all well down
below? But then, as if in answer, arose the vision of
glacial gray eyes and the echo of ominously quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
words: “Pop’s gun—I got it ready—if Snake comes
a-pesterin’ round he won’t never walk outen our
yard!”</p>

<p>The self-reliant girl was well able to defend herself.
He need not worry. But he began moving away, leaving
behind him the soft silvery bar. One last glance he
threw at it, and a hard smile twitched his lips.</p>

<p>“It was a treasure in Indian days,” he thought,
“and I haven’t a doubt that you, Snake, you ignorant
reptile, think you’re a coming silver king. But you’ll
never make much money out of those few bars of
lead!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>SNAKE STRIKES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Snake Sanders</span> has kilt his woman!”</p>

<p>Aghast, Douglas stood in his dark doorway, staring
down into the upturned face of Marion. Around them
the dusk was thickening into night, and in the shadow
of his porch it was dim indeed; but through the gloom
the eloquent gray eyes and the hushed voice spoke the
same shocked horror, pity, and wrath that stirred in
his own soul.</p>

<p>“Killed her? Killed Lou Brackett?” he repeated
slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes. She ain’t dead yet, but she can’t live long.
Poor woman, it’d been a lot better for her if she’d
missed that tree—she wouldn’t be sufferin’ now. But
then, there wouldn’t be a proof against him if she had.
Where you been all day? You must be the only one
into the Traps that ain’t heard. I was down here
twice—I wanted to tell you so’s you’d look out. They
ain’t caught Snake yet, and he might—well, you better
watch out.”</p>

<p>She turned, sweeping the darkling road with her
eyes. Nothing moved there. No sound came, except
the doleful sigh of a cold night breeze.</p>

<p>“Come in.” He moved back. “I want to know all
about this. The fire’s going—I was just getting supper.
Come in and keep warm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>For an instant she hesitated, instinctively dreading
entrance into the sinister house where her father and
Jake Dalton had met nameless doom. But then, realizing
that Douglas had lived here for weeks without
harm, she followed him in. Her moving feet made an
unwonted noise on the boards—the patter of leather-heeled
shoes, which the gnawing chill had at last compelled
her to don. The sombre echo of the sound in
the bare room halted her again.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got a light?” she requested. “I—I
don’t like this place, so dark and holler.”</p>

<p>“I’ll light up. Take this chair.” The one chair in
the place came rumbling toward her, and she sank on
it as he worked on the lamp. When the white flame
was lighting up the room he set the illuminator on the
table and turned to her, neglecting to draw the burlap
window-curtains which he had made some time ago.</p>

<p>“I was up in the rocks all day,” he explained.
“Found something, too, that may help to catch Snake.
But now tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is what I hear, and it’s what Lou said
her own self after she got so’s she could talk. Snake
took her up on top the Big Wall last night and throwed
her off——”</p>

<p>“Good God! Threw her off the Wall?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Snake ain’t been to home much
lately—you know that—but he’s come in a few times,
and then he was so ugly to her she dasn’t go lookin’
round to find out where he was when he was away.
He told her if she stepped a foot away from the house
he’d know about it, and he’d fix her so’s she wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
be able to walk or talk any more, and if anybody come
a-huntin’ him she’d got to say she didn’t know where
he was, and so on. But last night he come in ’long
toward dark, and he was laughin’ fit to kill. And
he said he’d got an awful good joke onto the detectives.</p>

<p>“She asked him what ’twas, of course, and he
wouldn’t tell her. But he said he’d show her if she’d
hurry up to the top of the Wall. He said the detectives
had got into the rocks down under the Wall,
and when she could see what they were up to she’d
’most die laughin’. But she’d have to come and see it
her own self.</p>

<p>“Well, Lou, she—she ain’t very bright, you know.
And she was so glad to see him good-natured and so
curious about this joke onto the detectives, she went
right ’long up there with him. And he went right to
the edge and looked round a little, and then he says:
‘There! See ’em, right up under here? It’s a-gittin’
dark down there, but look close and you’ll make ’em
out. Ain’t that funny, now?’</p>

<p>“Lou, she couldn’t see anything but rocks. But he
kept a-tellin’ her she was too far back, so she edged
up closer and closer, still a-lookin’. Then all of a
sudden she heard Snake laugh again, and he had
sneaked behind her, and that laugh scairt her. She
looked round quick, and he was grinnin’ like death.
And before she could move he shoved her off. The
murderin’ copperhead! He’d brought her up there
jest to kill her.”</p>

<p>Her fingers, twining and intertwining over one knee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
while she talked, gripped hard. Unable longer to sit
still, she sprang up.</p>

<p>“D’you know where he is? If you do, git him
quick! Lou wasn’t a friend to me—she hated me—but
he’s got to be kilt for what he done! He——”</p>

<p>“Go on,” he broke in. “Tell me all of it. Then
I’ll see what we can do.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, that’s right. Well, Lou would have
been kilt right quick, only for one thing. There was a
tree part-way down, growin’ right off the face of the
wall, the way they do sometimes—a hemlock, stickin’
out on a slant. And Lou struck right into it. She
was fallin’ awful fast, and she hit it so hard it—it
hurt her terrible; and the tree tore off from the little
ledge, and it went ’long down with her. She landed
into the rocks, of course. But that tree had stopped
her enough so that the rocks didn’t kill her.</p>

<p>“She laid there a long time, and when she got her
senses back it was all dark. But then a light showed
right close by, and what d’you s’pose she saw? Snake!
Snake, with an ax into one hand and a lantern into
the other, a-lookin’ for her!</p>

<p>“He must have seen that tree stop her, and he’d
come down through the Gap and worked ’long through
the rocks to be sure she was dead. He was a-callin’
to her, and sayin’ he’d help her, and so on. But she
kept dead still. She was into a shadow beside one of
the rocks, and he went right by her. She never moved
till he quit lookin’ and come back, swearin’ at her and
the dark and everything. And then when she was
sure he was gone, she started crawlin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>She stopped again, her hands clenched. Douglas,
visioning that awful scene at the base of the night-bound
crags, stood with jaw set. Presently she resumed
the tragic narrative.</p>

<p>“I dunno how she could do it, but she did—she
crawled down through the rocks and over pretty near
to the road. It took her more’n half the night to do
it—it was ’most two o’clock into the mornin’ when they
found her. She couldn’t git any further, and she laid
there a-cryin’ and a-screamin’—— Oh, why does God
let a devil like Snake live? Seems like He ain’t much
good to let sech things be!</p>

<p>“But anyway, there was two fellers out coon-huntin’,
and the dogs had run a coon up that way,
and they found Lou. It was Tom Malley and Joe
Weeks—they live ’way ’long on the Paltz road, and
they’d drove up this way to hunt. They went and
got their wagon and put Lou in and took her down to
the Malley place, and while Tom’s folks did what
they could he put for the doctor, ’way over to Paltz.
The doctor, he says she might live a few days, but
that’s all. She’s awful tough, like all the Bracketts—they
die hard. But she can’t live; she’s hurt too
bad.”</p>

<p>“And she was able to tell about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little to a time. And Missus Malley, Tom’s
wife, she was sharp enough to have it all wrote down.
There’s quite a family of ’em, the Malleys, and the
oldest boy is quick at writin’, folks say; and she made
him set there by the bed and write down every word
Lou said. The doctor said that was a right smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
thing to do, and the detectives said so too. They
didn’t have to ask her——”</p>

<p>“The detectives? Did they go down there?”</p>

<p>“One of ’em did. T’other stayed here. They’re
both here now. Tom Malley was so mad he drove up
here this mornin’ and told everybody he come across
about it, and he met the detectives, and one of ’em
went back with him—the quiet one that don’t look so
much like a bulldog.”</p>

<p>“Ward. He’s the brains of the combination. And
I suppose nobody else around here is doing anything
but talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t they? You’re the only one, Mister Hammerless
Hampton, that ain’t! Our fellers are kind of
rough, mebbe, some of ’em, but they don’t set still
after a thing like this! Every gun into the Traps is
out after Snake, ’ceptin’ yours and mine. And mine’s
been waitin’ for him ever since pop got kilt.”</p>

<p>“So has mine,” he reminded her. “What are the
boys doing?”</p>

<p>“They’re a-watchin’ every way out of the Traps.
They know he ain’t gone—they ’most caught him this
afternoon, up to his house. He didn’t know about
Lou bein’ alive and found, I s’pose, and he was gittin’
his stuff together as if he was goin’ somewheres—gun
and food and oil and so on—— What would he want
oil for, I wonder? Anyway, he skinned out of a back
winder when they jumped in at the door. Job Clark
shot at him, but he missed, and Snake got into the
woods and they lost him. But the house is bein’
watched now, and so’s every road and trail. He’s got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
his gun, though, and if you’re a-goin’ to stay in to-night
you’d better lock up tight. He might come and
git you. And now I’d better go home.”</p>

<p>“Wait. I’ll go along with you. But let me figure
on this thing first.”</p>

<p>For a silent minute or two he fixedly regarded the
blank wall. As steadily, she watched him. Soon he
nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s the best way,” he said, half to himself.
“I’d like to get him single-handed, but if he should get
me instead—nobody else would know where he was
hanging out. Yep, I’ll take some of the boys with
me.” Turning his gaze to her, he announced decisively:
“By to-morrow noon Snake will be dead or
in a trap he can’t squirm out of. I found his hole
to-day, and as soon as daylight comes I’ll get some of
the fellows together and we’ll bottle him up. No use
trying it to-night—I couldn’t find the place myself in
the dark. But if all the trails are watched he can’t go
anywhere else, and getting him will be easy. All we
have to do is to sit around like a bunch of terriers
watching a rat-hole, and when he comes out—nothing
to it!”</p>

<p>“Where? Where is it?” she demanded. “Are you
sure it’s his place? Mebbe—mebbe some of the
boys——”</p>

<p>“No, it’s none of the boys,” he smiled. “The boys
have cleaned up all their places lately—hid everything
somewhere, so the detectives wouldn’t see too much if
they went poking around. And I know this is Snake’s
place because his jug is there—green paint on one side—remember?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
I’ll tell you all about it some other time.
But now—say, here’s an idea! I’ll try to get those
detectives both up there, and while we know where
they are you go to Steve and try to make him leave
that cold hole of his and find a better place. If he
wants to make a run for it and leave the Traps awhile,
nobody’ll stop him——”</p>

<p>A shake of the head negatived his budding plan.</p>

<p>“He won’t run, and he won’t change, and he won’t
listen to sense,” she declared. “He’s more set and
wild than ever now. He’s got to git Snake, he says,
’fore somebody else does. I hadn’t ought to told him,
mebbe. But I did tell him—I went to him jest now
and told him ’bout Lou and all. I jest got back from
there—I ain’t even been home yet. I wish I’d kept
still. He’s crazy as a coot. He swore he’d come out
and git Snake his own self, detectives or no detectives,
and he’d take pop’s gun to do it with. I had
an awful time quietin’ him down. He’s sick again, too—his
lung’s bad some more.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! Sick again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sick again. He looks awful bad. I dunno
if he—— But I’d better git ’long home. He’s so wild
about Snake he might come and git that gun, sick or
no sick.”</p>

<p>“But you said you quieted him down.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe I did. I hope so. I told him he couldn’t
have that gun ’cause I had to have it my own self, and
that made him shut up. But he wouldn’t promise to
stay where he was—he wouldn’t say yes or no or
nothin’. And he’s so bull-headed when he gits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
his mind set, he might—— Well, I’m a-goin’.
G’by.”</p>

<p>As she turned doorward, he stopped her with a
swiftly formed decision.</p>

<p>“Just a minute more, Marion. I’m going with you,
as I said before; and I’m going to stay. My job to-night
is going to be standing guard at your house.
Then you and your mother can get a good sound sleep.
It isn’t Steve I’m thinking about—it’s Snake. If he
intends to call on anybody to-night it’s more likely to
be on you than on me. So if you don’t mind my sitting
on your steps——”</p>

<p>The sentence never was finished. Nor was the plan
ever carried out.</p>

<p>As Douglas turned to step toward his hat, coat, and
gun, the front door jumped inward.</p>

<p>Snake Sanders, shotgun leveled at his hip, evil face
aflame, stood in the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>TRAPPED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span> and sudden as was the appearance of that
murderous figure, it was little quicker than the movements
of Douglas and Marion.</p>

<p>For one fleeting second the pair stood as if petrified.
For the same time Snake halted as if blinded. Coming
from the outer dark, he had sprung straight into the
brightest beam of the gas-lamp, which happened to be
centered on the doorway. The shock to his optic
nerves was too great to be overcome at once even by
the instinctive narrowing of his lids. He wavered
aside, trying to dodge the sight-searing ray without
taking his gaze from the man he hated and the girl he
coveted.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the trapped pair leaped.</p>

<p>Douglas lunged toward his own gun—and tripped
over the forgotten low chair. Marion sprang between
him and the menacing muzzles which jerked to cover
him anew.</p>

<p>“Don’t you!” she screamed. “Don’t you dast
shoot!”</p>

<p>The clatter of the overturned chair and the thump
of a solid blow terminated her words. Douglas, unable
to regain his balance, had pitched headlong against
the stove. The impact dazed him. He fumbled, strove
to rise on legs that seemed useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>Snake’s venomous face split in a lethal grin. With
a hissing laugh he sidestepped, jumped forward,
snapped the gun-stock to his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crash!</span></p>

<p>Buckshot cannoned toward the groggy man reeling
up from the floor.</p>

<p>But the frightful charge of leaden death missed.
With the muzzle less than six feet from its victim—it
missed. It smashed through a window. The bellowing
shock of the discharge roared out into the silent
night, reverberating far along the crag-girt Traps.</p>

<p>Marion had leaped again. With the lightning speed
of a maddened catamount she had struck at the gun,
knocking it aside just as the hammer fell. Now she
was gripping the twin barrels in both her strong young
hands, wrenching and yanking in a furious effort to
wrest the weapon from its owner.</p>

<p>“Leggo!” snarled Snake. “Leggo, ye red cat!”</p>

<p>“I won’t—I got you now—Douglas!—Git him!”</p>

<p>She strained in frenzy, jerking, twisting—but ever
keeping the muzzles pointed upward.</p>

<p>Stunned anew by the concussion so near his head,
Douglas did not hear her panted command. Nor did
his numbed brain turn him of his own accord toward
his shotgun. Though he had carried that weapon
habitually of late, he was not a born gun-fighter; and
now, in his foggy condition, he acted only by primitive
instinct. But he was acting. He had regained
his feet, seizing the upturned chair as he rose; and
now he was lurching forward, poising the chair for a
crushing down-blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>With a louder snarl Snake heaved himself backward,
dodging away from the oncoming menace and swinging
up his gun with all his power, striving to break
the girl’s hold. But she hung on. Lifted clear of the
floor, still she hung on. And Douglas, his senses
quickening every instant, pressed in faster and
harder.</p>

<p>“Got you!” Marion gasped. “Right into the house—where
you—kilt my pop——”</p>

<p><i>Smash!</i></p>

<p>Glass shattered. Through the side window licked a
length of dull steel. Douglas almost collided with it.
He halted. It was another gun-barrel. And it covered
Snake and Marion.</p>

<p>“Marry!” crackled a harsh voice. “Git ’way!
He’s mine!”</p>

<p>Behind the cocked hammers of the gun glimmered
a white face: a drawn, haggard face dominated by
hollow eyes in which gleamed cold ferocity.</p>

<p>“Git ’way! Git back! Leggo that ’ere gun! I’m
a-shootin’!” came the ice-edged voice again. But the
commands ended in a cough, followed by a choked
moan of pain. The muzzles wavered. Then they
steadied again.</p>

<p>That voice, that face, that gun, seemed to freeze
Snake. Fear shot athwart his contorted visage. His
arms turned limp. Marion, feet again on the floor,
hands still desperately clutching the steel, flashed a
glance at the window, another at Snake—and tore the
gun from his relaxing fingers. An instant too late he
snatched for it. It was gone from him, and its muzzles—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
impotent, but the other deadly—were four
feet away, yawning at his face.</p>

<p>“Good gal!” A freezing chuckle sounded at the
shattered frame. “Don’t ye kill him less’n he jumps—he’s
mine! I got to talk to him a minute ’r so, an’
then—— Hamp, shove up the winder! I’m a-comin’
in.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, Steve,” Douglas replied mechanically.
“Never could get this sash up. It’s warped solid.
Come around.”</p>

<p>The fierce face hung in the dimness a moment
longer before it moved. Then, reluctantly: “Awright,
if I gotta I gotta. But ye watch him close!
He’s a snake—if he moves bust him!”</p>

<p>As the barrel withdrew Snake darted desperate
glances at the pair. He saw a tense, ready girl, flame-haired,
flame-eyed, holding him at bay like an angel
of vengeance; a grim-jawed man who once before
had knocked him senseless, who had been relentlessly
trailing him for many days, who now stood alert and
all too eager to avenge three attempts on his life. But
if he could only dodge that one barrel and dive through
the window——</p>

<p>“Don’t try it!” the hard voice of Hammerless
Hampton warned. “If she should miss you I
wouldn’t! I’m only holding off because you’re Steve’s
meat. Make one little move and——”</p>

<p>The threat of the hovering chair was all too plain.</p>

<p>Snake licked his thin lips, shot a look doorward—then
shrank back as if trying to merge himself with
the unyielding wall. A moment ago he had plumbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
the hot eyes of Wrath. Now he looked into the stony
countenance of Revenge.</p>

<p>Steve was in the room. Steve, born like a wolf,
wild as a wolf, now was merciless as a wolf. Through
his matted black hair his cavernous eyes glared in concentrated
hate; across his bristle-bearded mouth
stretched a fang-toothed grin; in his creeping step was
the stiffness of a timber-wolf about to leap and rend.
At his hip hung the battered double gun of dead
Nigger Nat, hammers back like the heads of striking
serpents, triggers tense under wasted fingers, muzzles
slipping with nerve-shattering slowness toward the
vitals of the cornered betrayer and murderer. So
appalling was the utter ferocity of that shambling figure
that Marion’s face paled and her weapon sank, while
even Douglas felt ice crawl down his spine.</p>

<p>“Three year!” the avenger rasped through his
teeth. “Three year I done for ye! I’d ’a’ died, only
I swored I’d git ye, Snake—I’d git ye ’spite o’ bars
an’ walls an’ guards an’ all hell! An’ now’s yer time
to pay! Ye’re gone!”</p>

<p>Snake’s face writhed again. Desperately he strove
to avert his doom.</p>

<p>“Steve, ye’re wrong! I tried to git ye clear——”</p>

<p>“Shet up! Ye dirty liar! Ye——”</p>

<p>“But wait, for Gawd’s sakes! Gimme a chance to
tell ye! Ye was drunk that night—ye was wild—crazy—I
couldn’t handle ye. Ye got ’way from me.
Fust I knowed, the place was a-burnin’ an’ ye
a-shootin’—I resked my own life a-tryin’ to git ye ’way—don’t
ye mind me a-haulin’ ye down the road an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
the Bumps a-shootin’ after us an’ how ye tumbled
sudden? I thought they’d hit ye, kilt ye, an’ I had to
look out for myself then. Mebbe ye don’t ’member—ye
was so drunk——”</p>

<p>“Ye lie! I was drunk—ye got me drunk a-purpose—but
I can ’member better’n ye think I can. Drinkin’
never makes me crazy: it makes me sleepy: but a
thing that happens when I’m drunk stays clear into
my head when I’m sober ag’in. Ye can’t wiggle out,
ye p’ison varmint! I’m a-shootin’ right quick. But
fust ye got to tell me how ye kilt Nat. Wha’d ye do to
him? Speak up, blast ye!”</p>

<p>“I never!” Snake’s voice rose to a scream. “I
never! Last I see o’ Nat that night he was a-trompin’
round the road crazy drunk. I was Nat’s friend—I
been your friend—I’m here now ’cause I’m friends
with all the Oakses! Lookit that feller Hampton!
He’s yer wust enemy! He set the ’tectives onto ye—he
tolled Marry into this ’ere house to-night—he’s
a-gittin’ her ’way from ye—he’s doin’ ye dirt to every
turn!”</p>

<p>The desperate play to distract Steve’s attention almost
succeeded. It was a diabolical stroke at the hard-bitten
youth’s innate distrust of outsiders and at his
jealousy. So unexpected was it that for an instant
Douglas and Marion stood staring blankly; and Steve,
brain aflame, nearly turned to confront them. Had he
done so, Snake could have jumped, shoved him toward
Marion, and sprung out of the door before either of
the guns—or the chair, which Douglas had lowered—could
stop him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>But he did not quite succeed. Steve’s eyes turned,
but the deadly muzzles did not swing more than an
inch. Then, just as a sinuous quiver of forthcoming
action ran through Snake, eyes and muzzles darted
back at him. Simultaneously Douglas stepped forward
with fists clenched and Marion with gun lifted.</p>

<p>“Hold up a minute, Steve,” Douglas requested
ominously. “I owe him one for that. You, Snake!
Step out and put up your hands!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you!” the girl rebuked him. “He’s a-tryin’
a trick! Steve, it’s all lies! I’ve got a good mind to
kill him my own self. But I ain’t a-goin’ to, and don’t
you shoot him neither. What good will it do to——”</p>

<p>“I been waitin’ three year! What ye think—I’ll
let him loose now?” A harsh cackle followed—ending
in another of those involuntary moans. Steve
lurched slightly. His face drew even tighter. “Keep
off, the both o’ ye!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Make him tell the truth!” Douglas shot back.
“Give him to the officers—they’ll get the truth out of
him—the truth that will clear you! Don’t you see?
You won’t have to hide any more then. You’ll never
have to go back to the pen. And he’ll get what’s coming
to him for murdering Lou. If you shoot him he
never can clear you—the law will be after you all your
life! Are you going to kill your own chances? Don’t
be a fool!”</p>

<p>His rapid counsel stayed Steve’s fingers even as
they tightened on the triggers. So set on personal and
deadly vengeance had the youth been that the thought
of making his betrayer rehabilitate him with the Law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
had never occurred to him. Even now the idea made
but slow headway against his fixed mania for revenge.
But he held his fire, letting the dazzling possibility
grow in his mind.</p>

<p>“That’s what I was tryin’ to tell you, Steve,” seconded
Marion. “He can’t talk if you kill him! Now
you git away—we’ll give him to the detectives—you
git back to the cave and stay there till we tell you to
come out——”</p>

<p>Snake broke in. He had been squinting wildly at
Douglas.</p>

<p>“Lou? Ye say I kilt Lou? I never! She—she
fell often the Wall—I didn’t have nothin’ to do with it—she
got dizzy——”</p>

<p>All at once his eyes widened, looking beyond them.
Douglas half turned, then forced his gaze back, suspecting
a trick. But it was no ruse. Quiet footsteps
sounded at the rear of the room. Then spoke a cool,
authoritative voice.</p>

<p>“Stand still, everybody. Don’t try anything sudden.
We’ll take charge of this thing now.”</p>

<p>Three heads jerked around. Snake still stared.
From the obscurity of Douglas’ sleeping-room had issued
two men who now advanced watchfully, right
hands under their coats. They were Ward and Bill.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the surprise of seeing those dreaded detectives
two men recovered quickest—Douglas, who had no
fear of them; and Snake, who had every fear of them.</p>

<p>Marion and Steve seemed frozen. Their guns had
swerved from Snake’s body. The door still stood
open, and between officers and criminal stood three
people. Snake broke for freedom.</p>

<p>But Douglas had thought of that. Hardly had he
glimpsed the officers when he swung back. At Snake’s
first move he sprang.</p>

<p>Snake reached the doorway. But he went no
farther. With the all-concealing darkness before his
eyes—something struck him. An arm swooped under
his jaw, yanking fiercely back on his throat. A knee
smote the small of his back, numbing his legs. A
savage fist crashed under his right ear. He collapsed.</p>

<p>Still holding his throat-lock, Douglas dragged him
back to the middle of the room and flung him down
with a thud that jarred the whole house.</p>

<p>“Here he is,” he said curtly. “Now grill him.”</p>

<p>“Good eye, Hampton,” Ward approved, smiling
grimly. “We couldn’t git to him with these kids in
the way. Guess you got a whole lot of satisfaction
out of that wallop, huh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>“A whole lot!” Douglas nodded, opening and shutting
his right fist. “Now you—— Steve! Quit
that!”</p>

<p>The refugee, his wolfish teeth bared, was slowly
backing doorward, his gun now covering the hated
trailers.</p>

<p>“Yeah!” snarled Bill, reaching backward again.
“Put that gun down and freeze right where y’are!
We wantcha, my fine boid!”</p>

<p>“Ye ain’t got me,” came the hoarse answer. “An’
ye don’t git me! Ye pull that gun o’ yourn an’ ye
won’t never shoot! I got ye cold!”</p>

<p>It was deadly truth, and Bill knew it. One twitch
of the fingers, and he would be a riddled corpse. But
he was brave enough. With his long-sought quarry
at last before him, he did not shrink from the cold
muzzles as he once had from the hammerless gun in
Marion’s hands, up the road.</p>

<p>“Ya got one chanst,” he growled. “Put that gun
down and wait while we sweat this guy. If he comes
acrost ya’ll be free. If ya shoot I’ll git ya before I
hit the floor.”</p>

<p>“And so will I,” Ward coolly added. “Show some
sense! We’re givin’ you a square deal. Now if you’re
guilty as charged, try makin’ your getaway. If you
ain’t, stick around. This guy here is goin’ to talk.”</p>

<p>Marion also, who had been tensely watching the pair,
turned on the gaunt fugitive.</p>

<p>“Steve, you heard what he said,” she challenged,
looking him straight in the eyes. “If you shoot or
run it’ll show you <i>did</i> burn out the Bumps! I want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
know my own self whether you did or not. You
better stay here.”</p>

<p>Through a silent pause Steve stood slit-eyed, studying
his foes: the men who had hounded him so long,
and the one who had caused that hounding. Snake
was reviving. He was staring blankly upward. On
him the hunted youth’s gaze fixed. Slowly he let his
weapon sink.</p>

<p>“Ye keep often me,” he warned. “I ain’t a-runnin’.
But I’m a-keepin’ my gun. I’m a-stayin’ right where
I be. Don’t ye come nigh me!”</p>

<p>“That’s good enough,” consented Ward, after a
shrewd look. “You stay right there. Now everybody
shut up. I want to talk to this guy Sanders.”</p>

<p>In an undertone, however, he said to Douglas:
“Kid looks sick and off his nut. Is he?”</p>

<p>“Sick, yes. Lungs. May be pneumonia,” was the
muttered reply. Ward frowned. Then he snapped at
Snake.</p>

<p>“You, Sanders! Git up and talk turkey! We’ve
got you dead to rights. No lies, now!”</p>

<p>Snake, sitting up, dizzily eyed each hard face.</p>

<p>“Wha—wha’d ye want?” he muttered thickly.</p>

<p>“Stand up! Back against that wall! Come on,
move! And don’t pull any gay stuff. You got some
explainin’ to do, and the less wigglin’ and dodgin’ you
try the better off you’ll be. Understand?”</p>

<p>Snake got up, looking confused. The other three
also glanced in a puzzled way at the officers. Here
was a murderer, condemned by the revelations of the
woman whom he had hurled to her doom; why did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
they not drag him out forthwith? They acted as if
they only meant to question him, and then, perhaps,
let him go.</p>

<p>But Douglas, studying Ward, felt that the man-hunter
knew what he was about, and said nothing.
Marion and Steve, too, kept silence. Sanders slouched
against the blank inner wall designated by Ward.</p>

<p>“Now git this in your head, first off,” Ward said
crisply. “We’ve been in here quite awhile. We’ve
been learnin’ a lot—about <i>you</i>. It’ll do you no good
to try any lyin’. You come clean, and you may save
a lot of trouble all around. Know what I mean?”</p>

<p>Snake nodded dubiously, but with hope beginning
to glimmer in his shifting eyes. Douglas saw light.
This assumption of omniscience and of infallibility in
detecting falsehood, this intimation that full confession
would benefit the prisoner—these were part of the
stock-in-trade of policedom, as the ex-newspaperman
well knew. They formed both a wordless threat and
an unexpressed promise: absolutely non-committal,
yet subtly potent.</p>

<p>“Well, then, what about this lad? Did he do that
burnin’ and shootin’, or did you? Remember he’s
right here, listenin’ to what you say. Bill, move over
a little. Sanders, you look the kid right in the eye.
Now then! What about it?”</p>

<p>As Bill, hovering ready at Sanders’ left, drew back,
Snake turned unwillingly and looked at Steve. The
youth made no movement, spoke no word; but his
glittering eyes bored into Snake’s inmost being. Under
that baleful glare, under the chill scrutiny of four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
other pairs of eyes, the yellow soul of Sanders
shriveled. He quailed visibly. Shifting his gaze, he
encountered again the piercing orbs of Ward.</p>

<p>“I—done—it,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“You did,” Ward repeated clearly. “All right.
That’s the stuff, Sanders, tell it straight. Now just
tell the whole thing—why you did it and how you did
it and all the rest of it. You’ll feel better then, maybe.
Come on, spill it all.”</p>

<p>Snake boggled over the start; but with a little more
brisk urging by Ward, whose manner was as matter-of-fact
as if the crime were nothing more serious than
fishing out of season, he began a hang-dog recital.
Ward, reaching into an inner pocket, quietly stepped
behind Douglas. The latter felt a note-book being
pressed against his back, followed by the quiver of a
rapidly moving pencil. Unseen by Snake, whose eyes
rested on the floor, the whole story was being recorded.</p>

<p>Shorn of twists and turns and blundering attempts
to show justification for the attack on the Bumps, the
confession corroborated the tale told by Steve that
afternoon in Uncle Eb’s kitchen. Snake asserted that
the Bump crowd had cheated him in a berry-picking
deal, stolen some of his “pick” outright, assaulted
him when he demanded his due; all of which perhaps
was true. He denied having plied Steve with liquor
in order to make him a scapegoat, but admitted having
deserted him after the commission of the crime. And,
so far as the crime itself was concerned, he cleared
Steve absolutely.</p>

<p>When his stumbling narrative was concluded, Ward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
gave him no rest. Whether or not confession be good
for the soul, man-hunters know that it is good for the
ends of justice to keep a criminal talking when once
he has started. Wherefore he briskly asserted:
“That’s good, Sanders, that’s fine. Now tell us what
happened to Nat Oaks. You were with him. Come
on, open up.”</p>

<p>“I—I—I dunno. I warn’t into this house with him.
Honest to Gawd!”</p>

<p>“Not in the house? Outside, though. Sure. Out
in the yard, now? You saw him come out, anyway.
What did he do?”</p>

<p>Snake wriggled; glanced around; licked his lips
again; looked cornerwise into Ward’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Wal—uh—I tell ye. Nat, he was crazy drunk.
He come down here to—to git Hampton. He was
p’ison mad ’bout them dawgs that Hampton kilt. I
come with him—I was tryin’ to git him to go home—I
didn’t want no——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that stuff. What did he do?”</p>

<p>“He—uh—he snuck in by hisself. I was out into
the road. He was into the house—all to oncet he give
a yell an’ he come a-runnin’. He never said nawthin’—he
was a-fussin’, like, into his throat, a-groanin’ an’
a-grumblin’—an awful kind of a noise! He come
a-tearin’ right by me an’ went <i>kersmash</i> into the bresh,
an’ I hearn him a-thrashin’ round into the dark, an’
then I didn’t hear him no more. An’ I was scairt—I
run right up the road an’ put for home. That’s
Gawd’s truth, fellers. I dunno what got him—’less’n
’twas Jake’s ha’nt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>His head was up now, and he looked into the faces
of the others as if telling the truth—or part of the
truth. Ward regarded him silently, perhaps deciding
to let the Oaks matter rest. Then Douglas shot a
sudden question.</p>

<p>“What did you have against Jake?”</p>

<p>Snake’s jaw dropped. He stared as if a ghost had
risen from the floor. Bill and Ward looked mystified,
but watched him keenly. From Steve sounded a low
grunt, as if he partly understood and wholly approved
the question. Marion, a rapt witness of the proceedings,
stood awaiting the answer though not comprehending
the purport of the demand.</p>

<p>“I—uh—me an’ Jake—we didn’t have no trouble,”
stuttered Snake. “What ye mean? We was good
friends——”</p>

<p>“Ye lie!” broke in Steve. “Ye said Jake stole yer
licker, an’ if he done it ag’in ye’d git him! I hearn ye
an’ Jake a-rowin’ ’bout it one time up into the rocks—before
I got sent away. Ye told him if he stole ’nother
jug o’ yourn he’d find snakes into it!”</p>

<p>“Aha!” Douglas pounced on the revelation. “And
he did steal another, eh? Did he? Quick, now!”</p>

<p>The vicious face reddened with quick anger.</p>

<p>“Yas, he did! He done it more’n oncet—the fat
hawg-bellied fool!—he’d steal every time he got a
chance. He was too lousy lazy to make his own——”</p>

<p>“And so you chopped off a rattler’s rattle and put
the snake in here! Didn’t you? Hurry up!”</p>

<p>“Yas, I did, ye smart Aleck! What of it? Puttin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
a snake into a house ain’t killin’ nobody. I only done
it to scare him.”</p>

<p>“So? A fine way to scare a man—cutting off those
rattles! You’ll be saying next that you only meant to
scare me awhile ago when you shot at me on the floor.
You only intended to scare me when you let that copperhead
out of the box on Dickie Barre, maybe—without
letting me know it was there. Of course!
You know mighty well what killed Jake, and Nat, too,
and you’ve been expecting the same thing to get me
here—that rattler. Now you all listen a minute while
I tell you what Dalton’s Death was.”</p>

<p>And for the first time Douglas revealed the truth
about the ha’nt.</p>

<p>“That’s the only reason why you let me live here in
peace,” he accused. “You thought your snake would
finish me as it finished Jake. When it didn’t you put
Nat up to stabbing me, while you stayed outside——”</p>

<p>“Ye can’t prove nothin’!” flared Snake, eyeing him
in hot hatred. “I wisht a dozen snakes had bit ye, ye
meddlin’ sneaker! But ye can’t prove what ye said—ther’
ain’t a witness nowheres! An’ how would I know
the snake had gone to livin’ into the bed? How’d I
know it didn’t go outen the house? I didn’t make it
bite Jake—I didn’t know ’twas here when Nat come—ye
can’t prove I put Nat up to comin’—an’ that shootin’
jest now was a accident—my thumb slipped——”</p>

<p>“Lies, lies, lies!” Douglas growled. “Accident?
The same kind of accident that threw Lou over the
edge of the Wall! But your accidents are finished
now, thanks to the accident that she hit that tree and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
wasn’t killed. All right, Ward. I’ll shut up. Take
him away.”</p>

<p>Ward was scowling, as if Douglas had upset his
program. But he nodded shortly and reached under
his coat. His hand came away with a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>“No need of any more grillin’, I guess,” he said.
“We’ve got all the proof we need about the Brackett
matter, and this guy can tell his side to the judge.
Stick out your hands, Sanders!”</p>

<p>Snake seemed paralyzed. His eyes were bulging,
and he stared at Douglas as if disbelieving his ears.
His mouth worked twice before words came.</p>

<p>“She warn’t kilt?” he blurted. “She ain’t dead?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but soon,” Ward snapped. “She’s dyin’,
but we’ve got her whole story wrote down and witnessed.
Didn’t know that, did you? Thought the
fellows around here were shootin’ at you just on
suspicion, hey? Nothin’ to it, Sanders—you’re up
against it cold. You give us the double-cross
once awhile ago, but we’re collectin’ on that little
deal now. Shove out those hands before I bust you
one!”</p>

<p>Utter desperation blanched Snake’s face. His hands
began to lift as if weights were dragging them down.
His hunted eyes flickered all about. Suddenly he
stiffened. His left hand flashed up, pointing.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” he screeched. “Ther’ she is—ther’ by
the winder! Lou! Lou! Come in an’ tell ’em it’s a
lie!”</p>

<p>So real was his sudden appeal that involuntarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
every man wheeled to see that imaginary figure beyond.
Instantly Snake struck.</p>

<p>His right fist shot against Ward’s neck, knocking
him headlong. His left smashed into the face of Bill,
who was turning back to him. Bill, too, toppled and
fell—but reached for his revolver even as he dropped.
Hampton, jumping at his enemy, collided with the
empty wall. Snake was not there.</p>

<p>He was flashing across the room. At the window
he stopped an instant. His hand licked out, seized
Hampton’s gun leaning against the wall. He spun
about, half leveled it at Hampton, jerked both triggers—got
no answering explosion. The safety was on,
locking the weapon against discharge. With an oath
he whirled to throw himself through the window.</p>

<p>A sharp report cracked from the floor where Bill
lay. It was drowned by a stunning crash beyond the
prone officer. The house heaved with the terrific concussion.
Blue smoke blurred the whole room.</p>

<p>Deafened, Douglas teetered on his heels, peering
through the haze at a mangled huddle under the window.</p>

<p>Faintly to his numbed ears came a piercing yell of
sated vengeance.</p>

<p>“I got him!” screamed Steve. “Both barrils!
<i>Yeeeeow!</i>”</p>

<p>Then, grinning like a mad wolf, the pain-racked
boy slowly crumpled to the floor and lay still.</p>

<small>OUT OF THE PAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> men straightened up and turned slowly away
from a shot-riddled thing which also had been a man.
Their gaze centered on another motionless form a few
feet away, its thin hands still clutched around a battered
old muzzle-loader. Beside that silent figure
knelt an anxious-eyed girl, down whose shoulders hung
disordered red hair.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ward in business-like tones, “this is
what I call a good clean-up. The quicker a snake
gits killed the better. This one’s as dead as they make
’em, and the State won’t have to spend a nickel on
givin’ him a trial and bumpin’ him off. Nor it won’t
have to give this kid any more board and lodgin’ down
the river. All we’ve got to do now is have you folks
witness that confession, and then we’ll drift out and
report. Sanders was shot resistin’ arrest, and Bill
here done the shootin’. Ain’t that right, Bill?”</p>

<p>He winked at his burly partner. Bill grinned heavily
and returned the wink.</p>

<p>“Yeah. That’s right. Killed by Officer William
Moiphy in p’formance o’ dooty. I dunno if I hit him,
but I shot and he croaked, and that’s good enough for
the records. But what about the kid? Hadn’t we
oughter take him out till they fix up the red tape
down below?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Nope,” decisively. “We can fix that. Kid can’t
travel anyway. Might kill him. We’ll leave him lay
here and git better if he can. More’n that, I’m goin’
to send that Brackett woman’s doctor up here to tend
to him. Charge the bill up to expenses. The State
owes him that much, anyway. Now, sister, let’s have
a look at him.”</p>

<p>As Ward stooped over the unconscious youth the
girl drew back in instinctive distrust, one hand slipping
toward the gun she had captured from Snake. The
man gave her a look half-amused, half-warning.
Douglas spoke soothingly.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Marion. Maybe you didn’t notice
what was said just now. Steve’s cleared, and Ward
here is going to send in a doctor. These fellows are
leaving—and so am I. Steve will be well soon, and
then you two can get married, and—and—everything’s
all right.”</p>

<p>Despite himself, his last words sounded hollow. He
turned his gaze to the wan face of the wolf-boy,
sombrely contemplating the sunken cheeks, the deep-rimmed
eyes, all the painfully apparent ravages of
privation and sickness. He did not observe the sudden
amazement in the three other faces, which turned
quickly to his; nor the ensuing tiny tremble of the
girl’s lips.</p>

<p>“Huh? These two git—— Gee, I thought—— Huh!”
muttered Bill, blankly looking from boy
to girl and then back at Hampton. Ward, too,
stared; then, tongue in cheek, looked down again at
Steve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Git married? Me and Steve?” breathed Marion.
“And you—you’re goin’——”</p>

<p>A moan from the floor, a shudder of the ragged
body and a trembling of the hands around the gun,
cut her short and drew the attention of all. The pale
lips twitched; the eyes opened, steadied on Ward’s
face. The jaw clicked shut. Steve struggled to
rise.</p>

<p>“All right, lad,” Ward said kindly. “We don’t
want you. Take it easy. You’re in the clear, and
Sanders is croaked, and we’re goin’ out and leave you.
Now you’d better git to bed. Hampton, want to put
your blankets around him? And shut that back window
of yours. We left it open——”</p>

<p>“That’s how you got in?”</p>

<p>“Sure. We spotted that easy-slidin’ window days
ago—made a little call here and looked things over
again, just for luck. I don’t aim to overlook anything
when I’m on a job. So to-night when we heard that
cannon go off we took it on the run, looked in here
and saw you had got Sanders cornered, and eased ourselves
in by that window to git an earful of what you
were raggin’ about. It helps a lot sometimes to hear
things without lettin’ folks know—— Huh? What’s
that, kid?”</p>

<p>Steve was trying to break in. Now he gasped:</p>

<p>“Leave me lay. Go look out for mom. Snake, he
mauled her. He went there—’fore he come here. I
found her all——”</p>

<p>Marion sprang up with a cry.</p>

<p>“Mom? Snake hurt her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“Yuh—he mauled her awful. She told me—take
the gun and—see if ye was here. I put her on the
bed—and I come a-runnin’. She’s hurt bad. Git to
her.”</p>

<p>Douglas and Bill tensed. Ward straightened with a
snap.</p>

<p>“More dirty work!” growled Ward, with a hard
look at the dead man beyond. “We’d all better git up
there. Say, Miss Oaks! How about bringin’ this
Steve to your house? This ain’t a good place for
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bring him, bring him! Poor mom! I’m
a-goin’!”</p>

<p>She sped into the night. Ward moved swiftly after
her.</p>

<p>“Bill, you and Hampton fetch him along,” he commanded.
And he, too, was lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Hastily Douglas gathered his blankets and threw
them around Steve, who doggedly strove to stand on
his own legs but could not. Deprived now of the
vengeful force which had sustained him so long, he
was utterly without strength. But his wasted frame
was no burden at all to the muscles of the two strong
men aiding him. And a moment later, bundled in
warm woven wool, he was being borne rapidly along
the road, his tortured chest enwrapped in the bulging
arms of the man who had remorselessly hunted him,
his legs upheld by the tall “furriner” who had stood
by him ever since his return from prison walls. Before
the three, the white beam of the gas-lamp lit up
the road. Behind, stiffening in the blackness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
eerie house where at last he had entrapped himself,
lay the creature whose venom would never more menace
the dwellers in the Traps.</p>

<p>At the door of the Oaks house Ward met them.
His face was grave.</p>

<p>“Put him on this here cot,” he quietly directed.
“I’ve got the fire goin’ and some water on.” Lowering
his voice and nodding toward an inner room where
an oil lamp shone feebly, he added: “She’s in there.
Can’t do anything for her. She’s all busted up inside.
Hemorrhages. She won’t last till daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Talkin’ any?” hoarsely whispered Bill.</p>

<p>“Nope. Just holdin’ the girl’s hand. She might say
somethin’ later on. We’ll stick around.”</p>

<p>They lowered Steve to a rickety sofa, opened the
blanket-roll encasing him, and bared his ridge-ribbed
chest. Ward tiptoed about and found mustard and
cloths. Bill, clumsily anxious to do something but
ignorant of how to go about it, fidgeted a moment and
then appointed himself guardian of the fire. Steve,
lips pressed together, lay still, moving only his eyes,
which went back and forth between Douglas and the
doorway of the inner room. The blond man nodded
and stole to the portal.</p>

<p>Within, he saw two faces: one thin, dark, pillowed
in a worn old bed—a face gray-white beneath its
swarthiness; the other fair, rounded, but white and
set, leaning close. Across the mouth of the sufferer
lay a towel blotched with red stains, and from the
headboard another hung ready. The black-browed
eyes were closed, and across the forehead above them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
softly stroked gentle tapering fingers. On the shabby
counterpane a work-worn old hand and a shapely
young one were joined. Somewhere a cheap clock
ticked as if hurrying along the last hours of the injured
woman’s life. That, and difficult breathing,
were the only sounds.</p>

<p>Marion’s head turned, and for a moment her grief-stricken
eyes dwelt on the blue ones at the doorway.
Then they returned to the face on the pillow. Douglas
withdrew. In that straight look he had found confirmation
of what his own gaze and Ward’s laconic
words had told him.</p>

<p>He shook his head soberly at Steve and at the other
two, watching him. The boy’s mouth set harder; but
he said nothing. Ward went on making a hot poultice.
Bill shifted his feet and awkwardly fed another stick
into the stove.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite git it,” Ward mused in an undertone,
as the three gathered around Steve. “What
would Sanders beat her up for?”</p>

<p>“For the same reason that he would kill Lou Brackett
and shoot at me,” Douglas explained. “It all fits
in together. The reason is—Marion.”</p>

<p>“Wanted her, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. He couldn’t have her and Lou too, so
he got rid of Lou. He threw her off the Wall because
that would look like an accident. A snake-bite
wouldn’t do, because folks would be too suspicious,
especially since snakes are denning up now. Any
other form of murder, too, would look bad. A fall
off the Wall would be the most natural thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>“Mrs. Oaks, here, hated Sanders, and he knew it.
From what Steve tells us—that she told him to leave
her and see if Marion was at my house—Sanders must
have come here determined to drag the girl away to a
hole in the rocks where he’s been hiding lately. She
probably cussed him out—maybe threatened him with
the gun—and he thought Marion was here. So he
jumped on her, pounded her like the murderous brute
he was, searched the house, and then came to my
place; saw us in there, and jumped in to finish me and
grab her before she could get to my gun.”</p>

<p>“Sounds reasonable,” Ward nodded, drawing
Steve’s shirt together over the deftly arranged plaster.
“He sure was a hard guy. Well, there’s no more to
do now but wait. You git to sleep, lad, if you can.
I’m goin’ out for a little smoke.”</p>

<p>He passed to the bedroom doorway, looked in, then
quietly opened and closed the outer door. A minute
later, outside a window, showed the flare of a match
and the glow of a pipe.</p>

<p>Time dragged past. Steve lay silent. Bill and
Douglas sat wordless. Ward returned, found some
cold biscuit and butter, made a big pot of coffee,
passed them around. From time to time one or another
of them stepped to the door and looked in on
the girl keeping her grim vigil; then tiptoed back and
resumed his seat.</p>

<p>Hour after hour crawled along, measured only by
the unfeeling tick of that cheap clock, which had no
hour-bell. Steve slept. Bill dozed, sprawling in his
chair. Ward and Hampton nursed empty pipes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
From the room beyond came occasional choking noises,
but no voice.</p>

<p>Then, low but penetrating, sounded a call for aid.</p>

<p>“Douglas! Come help me!”</p>

<p>In six strides Douglas was beside Marion, who was
supporting the older woman’s bony shoulders in her
arms. The dark eyes were open now, and the red-dyed
mouth was gasping for breath.</p>

<p>“She wants to be lifted,” added the girl. “I
can do it, but I might shake her. Jest raise her
easy.”</p>

<p>With a smooth lift he set Eliza against the pillows
which Marion erected at her back. One glance into
the ashy face and the glassy eyes told him that the end
was close at hand.</p>

<p>For a minute or two the dying woman looked fixedly
at him. She seemed gathering her strength. Her gaze
went to Marion. Then it centered again on Hampton’s
strong, clean face.</p>

<p>“I’m a-goin’,” she breathed. “Snake done it. Did
ye—git him?”</p>

<p>“Steve got him,” he answered. “Got him with
Nat’s gun. Both barrels. He owned up first, though,
that Steve didn’t burn out the Bumps. Steve goes
free. Everything’s all right. Don’t talk.”</p>

<p>A wild light filled the fixed eyes. A haggard smile
crooked the thin lips.</p>

<p>“Steve done it! Nat’s gun! That’s good! Awful
good!”</p>

<p>A sudden cough and a fresh red flow stopped her.
Then, instead of drooping back, she seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
straighten and strengthen. Her breath came short, but
more easily.</p>

<p>“I got to talk. Don’t hender me. I ain’t got much
time. I got to tell ye—’fore I go. Marry—ain’t ourn.”</p>

<p>Douglas started.</p>

<p>“Not yours? Not your daughter?”</p>

<p>“No. I never had no—young ’uns of my own. We
got Marryin—three year old. Her pop was—a painter
feller. From Noo York. Name was Dyke.</p>

<p>“He come into here—fourteen year ago—paint pictures.
Wife had got drownded—sailboat sunk into
ocean—nigh Noo York, he—told us. He was awful
grievious ’bout it. Come up here to paint an’—git over
it. Brought his little gal—Marryin—all he had left—little
rosy gal—purty as a angel.</p>

<p>“We was more ’spectable then. Nat he worked—didn’t
drink much—hunted an’ trapped—made a good
livin’. Dyke wanted board with us. We let him. He
went paintin’—up ’long the crick—up onto Minnewasky—diff’rent
places. Little Marryin stayed here
mostly—’count o’ snakes—daddy was scairt she’d git—bit
if she went ’long o’ him.</p>

<p>“Dyke was good feller but—quick-tempered—git
fightin’ mad like a shot. Him an’ Nat—they had two-three
spats. One time they went huntin’. Nat come
home ’lone. Said Dyke fell offen Dickabar. Kilt.</p>

<p>“We got him outen—the rocks. Buried him out
back. Nat got drinkin’—talkin’ into his sleep—let out
that him an’ Dyke fit ’bout suthin’. Nat busted his
neck. When he see what he—done, he throwed him—offen
Dickabar to look like—he fell by—hisself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>“’Course I never told. Nat he was my man. Snake
Sanders, he—knowed or ’spicioned—I dunno how—but
he kep’ Nat scairt. Made Nat do—dirty work.
But he never—told on him. Nor I wouldn’t—tell ye
now but—Nat he’s gone—can’t nobody hurt him now.
I’m a-goin’ too—Marry she’ll be ’lone—’ceptin’ for
Steve an’—you. One o’ ye’s got to—look out for her.”</p>

<p>She gasped, struggled up straighter, fought off the
tightening clasp of Death. Her dimming eyes traveled
about the blur of hovering faces. Except Steve, asleep
outside, all in the house now were clustered around the
bed.</p>

<p>“Ye—Hampton—I been mad at ye—but—ye come
from outside—like Marry’s pop. Marry she—b’longs
outside too. Her folks was quality—she warn’t borned
into—Traps. She’d oughter go out.</p>

<p>“Steve an’ her, they—growed up like brother an’—sister.
They knowed they warn’t—but they been the
same. Steve got livin’ with us—I dunno jest when—he
was little feller—he jest come an’ stayed. They
growed—like I said. He’s good boy but—he ain’t
fitten to—take care o’ Marry. Too wild—too young—he
ain’t got a stiddy head—ye know what I—mean.
I’d go easier to know she was—took care of by—strong
man that knowed things.”</p>

<p>She strove to make out the expression on the face of
the blond blur which was Hampton. She could not.
But to her failing ears came a deep-toned, solemn
promise.</p>

<p>“I will take care of her. As if she were my own
sister.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>Another faint smile fluttered and faded. The black
head sank back wearily. Once more the stiffening lips
moved.</p>

<p>“Marry gal—I might of—done better—by ye. I
cussed ye—knocked ye round—but I kep’ ye—safe.
Snake nor no other—varmint never—got ye. I done
the—best I—knowed how. I—I’m—a-goin’——”</p>

<p>A quiver ran from breast to lips. The arms went
limp. The body relaxed.</p>

<p>Nigger Nat’s woman—primitive product of harsh
hills, hard-bitten, hard-spoken, unmannered and unlovely,
yet loyal to the last to her man and the waifs
whom she had taken to her craggy heart—had laid
down the burden of life and passed on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>THE CALL OF THE SOUTH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brilliant</span> morning sunlight flooded the dingy
kitchen-dining-living-room of the Oaks house. Late
though the season was, the southward-rising sun now
lit up the interior more clearly than it ever had in mid-summer;
for its slanting rays, instead of sinking into
green ground and foliage, now ricocheted upward
from a thin earth-blanket of snow.</p>

<p>That snow was two days old, and the latest of three
light falls which had come since the night when Snake
Sanders and his last victim passed out. The other two
had speedily melted, and even this one had shrunk
noticeably in an ensuing thaw. But to-day the air
was keen and the white coverlet hard.</p>

<p>Snow and cold, however, meant little to the eight
gathered in that room. In the cheery warmth radiating
from the mud-colored old stove four of them
crouched or lay in the sleepy contentment of full
stomachs, while the other four sat pensively on chairs
or sofa. The floor-hugging contingent comprised the
Oaks felines—Spit and Spat and Fit and Fat. The
folks above them were Marion, Steve, Douglas, and
Uncle Eb.</p>

<p>Beside the outer door stood two guns—one, an old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
rust-pitted muzzle-loader; the other a clean, graceful
hammerless—and a blanket-pack, to which a smaller
bundle had been lightly corded. To a contemplative
eye those insensate things would have told a story of
double trust: that, as the guns stood side by side, so
would their owners stand shoulder to shoulder; and
that the man who presently would carry that pack
would bear also the light burden of a woman who had
faith in him—for that small package was unmistakably
a thin dress, within which probably were wrapped
a few other articles of clothing.</p>

<p>“Wal,” barked Uncle Eb, shattering a thoughtful
silence, “ye might say this was the endin’ an’ the
beginnin’. Nat an’ ’Lizy an’ Snake an’ Lou are all
into their graves, an’ them detective fellers are so long
gone I ’most forgot they ever was into here, an’ Steve’s
back onto his legs, an’ Marry an’ Hammerless are
a-goin’ out. An’ that’s the endin’. But then ag’in,
Steve’s a-comin’ to live ’long o’ me, an’ if old Ninety-Nine’s
Mine ain’t lost ag’in by next spring we’ll see
what we can make outen it; an’ Marry’s a-startin’ into
that thar art-school ye told about, Hamp; an’ ye say
ye’re a-goin’ to quit driftin’ round an’ git into a reg’lar
business down to the city—sellin’ bonds, did ye say?
An’ so that’s the beginnin’. Now all I’m bothered
’bout is how I’m a-goin’ to keep these cats to my
house. They’ll run right back here, I bet ye.”</p>

<p>“When they see ther’ ain’t nothin’ to eat here they’ll
come a-scootin’ up the hill ag’in, don’t worry,” predicted
Steve, a saturnine smile crooking his pale mouth.
“Ther’ won’t be nobody livin’ into here, ’less’n Marry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
gits homesick an’ wants to come back. Anybody
else that tries movin’ in will move out ag’in quick’s
I can git to him. Marry, don’t ye kind o’ hate to
go?”</p>

<p>“I—dunno,” she slowly answered. “It’s the onliest
home I ever knowed, but—but it ain’t the same now.
No! I—I <i>couldn’t</i> live here! Now that I know who
my real daddy was, and—and I’ve got a chance to
draw real pictures and—and <i>be</i> somebody ’sides ‘Nigger
Nat’s girl’ and ‘that red-headed catamount’ and
all——”</p>

<p>She paused, her eyes shining as the misty portal of
Dreams swung back and gave her a vision of what
lay beyond. The three men nodded; Douglas understandingly,
Uncle Eb decisively, Steve sombrely.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Douglas agreed. “You’ve been underground
long enough, and now you must blossom
out into the sun. It’s your daddy’s blood that has
driven you to draw and dream, and he’d tell you now
to go out and develop your talent. That’s his heritage
to you—that urge to draw—and you owe it to him to
make something of it. It means work, but it’s worth
while.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can work—won’t I work, though! And—and
some day I’m comin’ back up here and draw that
hole in the crick that’s bothered me so long—and paint
it, too—and make it right!”</p>

<p>Her slender fingers closed and her cheeks flushed in
joyous enthusiasm. Steve eyed her soberly, then
nodded again.</p>

<p>“Yas, tha’s right, I reckon,” he sighed. “It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
a-goin’ to be awful lonesome ’thout ye, Marry gal, but
mebbe ye won’t forgit us. I—I——” He stopped
abruptly and gulped.</p>

<p>“Why—why, Stevie!” She sprang up and stroked
his hair. “I won’t never forgit you, never! You’ve
always been good to me—stood up for me like a real
brother many’s the time—it ’most broke my heart when
they sent you away. And when the noo-mony got you
jest lately I——”</p>

<p>“Don’t say no more,” he broke in huskily. “Ye’ve
stood up for me too, an’ ye pulled me through that
noo-mony, an’ I couldn’t ask no more. But I got to
tell ye, Marry—I ain’t ’shamed to say it right out front
of everybody—I got thinkin’ mebbe sometime we might—might
git married, all reg’lar, with a ring an’ everythin’,
I hadn’t no right to, but I couldn’t help it. But
then I see it warn’t no use. I done a lot o’ thinkin’,
up thar into my hole into the ground, an’ I could see
plain ye was ’way over my head.”</p>

<p>His teeth set, and the hard lines around his mouth
deepened. But he drove himself on.</p>

<p>“An’ I see the kind of a feller ye’d oughter have was
like Hamp, here. An’ that’s mostly why I resked it to
put that note under yer door, Hamp, the night Nat
come——”</p>

<p>“What! Was it you who did that?” exclaimed
Douglas.</p>

<p>“Me. Snake an’ Nat was right close by my hole,
never knowin’ I was into it, an’ Snake was edgin’ Nat
on to go down an’ do for ye. When they was gone I
wrote that warnin’ an’ snuck down ’long Dickabar an’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
left it for ye. I owed ye a good turn anyways, but I
done it for Marry more’n for you.”</p>

<p>A moment Douglas sat, realizing what the fugitive
had risked in thus issuing from his covert and threading
a mile of detective-haunted forest. Then he
reached out and grasped the bony hand of the convalescent.</p>

<p>“You’re a man!” he declared.</p>

<p>“I aim to be,” said Steve, with another gulp.</p>

<p>A short, awkward silence followed. Marion, sober-faced,
tenderly stroked the shaggy black hair until
Steve dodged, as if the caress were becoming torment.
Uncle Eb glared fixedly at one of the cats. Douglas
looked at all three; then arose as if reaching a determination.</p>

<p>“This isn’t the way I’d thought of it, but it’s as
good as any,” he said quietly. “I had intended first,
Marion, to take you to an elderly friend of mine in
town—Mrs. Wright, who takes a keen interest in
young artists and who undoubtedly would remember
your father. She’s a dear old soul, and I know she’d
be only too glad to make everything easy for you;
she’s a patroness of that school I spoke of, and besides
that she could coach you on all those little things a
lady of her type knows so well—speech and manners
and clothes and the other points you’ll have to learn in
order to ‘be somebody,’ as you say. And I’d rustle a
job down in the financial district and keep my promise
to your mother—to look out for you as if you were
my sister. And when you’d had time to see how you
liked the change, and to find out what the city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
boys looked like, and so on—then I’d ask you a question.</p>

<p>“I wanted to give you a fair chance—not to jump
this question at you before you fairly got your eyes
open to this new world of yours. But circumstances
alter cases. I’ll take you to Mrs. Wright just the
same, but I’m going to ask the question now instead of
later. Like Steve, I’m not afraid to say it right out
in front of everybody. What’s more, Steve has the
right to know what’s what. And——”</p>

<p>He paused. The wide gray eyes dwelt unwaveringly
on his. So did the old steel-blue eyes and the young
brown ones.</p>

<p>“The first time we met,” he went on, with a little
smile, “you said you were ‘Marry for short.’ I’m
asking you if you’ll make it ‘marry for good.’ If so,
we’ll hunt up a parson when we tramp into New
Paltz, and go down the river as Mr. and Mrs. Hampton.”</p>

<p>Steadfastly she regarded him a moment longer.
Steve and Uncle Eb sat breathless.</p>

<p>“Let me ask you somethin’,” she returned. “If
Steve had got sent back down-river you’d never have
asked me this, would you?”</p>

<p>“Why—if I still thought you and he were sweethearts—probably
not. It wouldn’t be fair to either of
you.”</p>

<p>“Was that what you meant when you spoke ’bout
Steve—that day up the crick?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. What did you think?”</p>

<p>“I thought all ’long you—didn’t want to git too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
thick with a girl that was a—a half sister to a feller
that had been into the pen! That you couldn’t have
enough respect for a girl like that to—to—you know.
And it—kind of hurt.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord! I never even knew you two were
brought up under the same roof, until the night your
mother—that is, ’Liza Oaks—died. If I had, maybe
I’d have asked sooner!”</p>

<p>The cool gray eyes grew warm. The red lips curved
in a dimpling smile. But his question remained unanswered.
Her gaze went to the waiting packs and
guns. Outside, a horse stamped impatiently.</p>

<p>“Ain’t it about time to be goin’?” she asked demurely.
“That hoss of Uncle Eb’s is gittin’ restless.
Uncle Eb, you’d better git the cats into the bags.”</p>

<p>“But ye ain’t told Hamp——” Steve protested.</p>

<p>“I know it, foolish! And I ain’t goin’ to tell him
till I git ready. It might be five minutes, or mebbe
five years, he’ll have to wait; and till he knows you
won’t know either. And that’s all of that!”</p>

<p>Uncle Eb chuckled. Douglas spread his hands in
resignation. Steve glowered, then half grinned.</p>

<p>“Might a-knowed it,” he muttered. “Sassy as a
red squir’l, ain’t ye? Ye won’t never git no better.”</p>

<p>And with that the question was dropped. Ensued
a scramble, ending in the confinement in burlap sacks
of four spitting, spatting felines; a donning of hats
and coats, a closing up of stove-draughts, and a wobbly
progress by Steve to Uncle Eb’s waiting wagon. There
he was enwrapped in a huge quilt. Uncle Eb clambered
in and encased his legs in the horse-blanket.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
The horse started at once. And up the road slowly
traveled the old man and his new foster-son, with dead
Nigger Nat’s muzzle-loader leaning stark and grim
between them.</p>

<p>Behind them, swinging easily along the frozen road,
walked the man and the maid, their faces reddening
under the sharp kiss of the wintry air. Once, and
once only, they paused to glance back at the abandoned
house. Then they trudged on, silent.</p>

<p>At length the wagon stopped. The Clove road had
ended, and the horse now stood in the true Traps road,
heading westward. Up that way waited Uncle Eb’s
home. Eastward opened the Gap, and beyond lay
the great Outside. This was the parting of the
ways.</p>

<p>And here Steve spoke out, man to man.</p>

<p>“Hamp, I’m a-trustin’ ye. But a feller never knows.
If ever Marry should come a-crawlin’ back into here,
sorry an’ shamed, then look out! I’ll be a-comin’
after ye wuss’n I ever went after Snake, an’ I’ll come
a-shootin’. Tha’s all. Good luck to the both o’ ye.”</p>

<p>“You won’t be coming after me, lad,” Douglas answered
steadily. “We’ll both be coming back to see
you in the spring, whether Marion’s name then is Dyke
or Hampton. And I’m leaving with you, as a pledge
and a present—this.”</p>

<p>Into the space between the two riders he swung his
shotgun. Then he gripped Steve’s hand and stepped
back. The youth stared at his new gun as if the
heavens had opened before him. Even when Marion
climbed up and kissed him farewell he seemed dazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
by the wonder of actually possessing such a weapon.
Uncle Eb grinned dryly and gave Douglas an approving
nod.</p>

<p>The old man’s farewell was characteristically short.
He gave each a straight look, a lift of the walrus
mustache, a paralyzing handshake. Then——</p>

<p>“Luck to ye! G’yapalong!”</p>

<p>The wagon rolled away.</p>

<p>With a sigh and a smile, Douglas and Marion turned
their faces eastward. Steadily they swung along the
hummocky track, climbing upward, ever upward, by
easy grade or steep slant, toward the Gap a mile away.
From time to time they glanced at each other, but
they spoke no word. The only sounds were the flapping
of frozen leaves still adhering to cold boughs, the
crunch of snow under heel, the occasional bay of a
far-off hound.</p>

<p>So they came to the Jaws of the Traps, where the
road sneaked between towering ledges and then pitched
down in swift-dropping zigzags to the low hills of the
Beyond. Out before them stretched a snowy panorama
through which, black and slow, meandered the
serpentine Wallkill. Away to the east, hidden behind
intervening hills, flowed the wide Hudson. Far to the
south, that river rolled past the vast city of New
York, to be swallowed by the waiting ocean. But
much nearer—only six miles off—stood out clearly a
little town where lived clergymen, and where a wedding
ring could be bought; the first town on their outward
way: New Paltz.</p>

<p>There between the crags they halted, poising on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
brink between the Traps and the World, the hard old
life and the nebulous new. Still they said nothing.
His gaze dwelt on her, and hers on that town. Something
counseled him to keep silence.</p>

<p>Then into the stillness came a sound from the north:
a sound new to the man: a yapping confusion of noise
suggesting the breathless chorus of a pack of hard-running
dogs. It grew in volume until it became like
the strident creak and groan of many rickety, unoiled
wagons, full of discordant undertones and overnotes.
Yet it was not on the ground, but in the air, somewhere
beyond the northern cliff which blocked the
view.</p>

<p>“Geese!” cried Marion. “I wondered why we
hadn’t heard some. They’re late. But they’re goin’
fast now. The lakes up north are froze, and winter’s
comin’ close. There they are!”</p>

<p>High up, a long wedge slid across the sky. Its lines
wavered, bent, but never broke. Along them winked
an unceasing quiver of strong-beating wings; from
them fell the clamorous medley of voices old and
young, deep and shrill. Straight as their wild instinct
could guide them, straight as the man and the
maiden below would speed down the river when
they should reach the railroad, the birds were flying
south.</p>

<p>“Goin’ south—and so are we,” the girl softly
echoed his own thought. And they turned their eyes
again to the roofs six miles away.</p>

<p>“Marion—dear—what is it to be?” he asked.
“Let’s decide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>A deeper color flowed into her cheeks, a roguish
twinkle into her eyes. Half shyly, she looked up at
him.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you scairt to marry a red-headed catamount?”
she demanded. “They’re awful critters to
git along with.”</p>

<p>“I never married one yet, but I’m not scared,” he
smiled. “I’ve held my own with every one I’ve met
so far.”</p>

<p>Under the curving brows flamed a daring, tantalizing
light.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you—you ain’t holdin’ your own right
now,” she teased.</p>

<p>He blinked. Then light shot over his face. One
stride, and his arms were around her.</p>

<p>“Who says I’m not?” he challenged.</p>

<p>“That’s—that’s better!”</p>

<p>Her arms clasped tight around his neck. Her lips
rose, tremulous, questing, waiting. His head dropped,
and his embrace tightened. And then between the
crusted crags there stood no longer a girl of the hills
and a man from outside. Lip to lip, heart to heart,
soul to soul—the twain had become one.</p>

<p>After a time his head lifted. Passive, clinging,
trembling, she lay back in his arms.</p>

<p>“Are you—sure we can find a—a parson down to
Paltz?” she whispered.</p>

<p>He laughed, and drew her up to him again. Yielding
lips stopped his breath, and the laugh died. But
faintly from the south sounded an echo of his tender
mirth—a bubbling, gabbling sound which in turn died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
out and was gone: the honking hilarity of the sharp-eyed
wild geese.</p>
